His stage name "Tyga" stands for "Thank You God Always." The California-born rapper has enjoyed a rapid rise into the upper echelons of the hip hop world.</p><p>His popular mixtapes landed him a record deal with Young Money Entertainment in 2007, and one of the first tracks,&nbsp; a song with <a href=# title="Chris Brown Net Worth">Chris Brown</a>, called "Deuces", was nominated for a Grammy Award for "Best Rap/Sung" Collaboration.&nbsp; Since then, he has released one more moderately successful album, which spawned two Top 40 hits, and three more Top 100 songs.</p><p>Musically, he is best recognized for hit singles like "Faded" and "Rack City," to name a few. Personally, he is infamously known for formerly dating Kylie Jenner and having a child with model Blac Chyna.</p><p>Outside of his music career, Tyga has made a small fortune on the adult social network OnlyFans. He was reportedly at one point the platform's fifth highest earning personality. He reportedly made $8 million on OnlyFans in roughly a year.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-267772 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-80271514-e1535609121691.jpg alt width=900 height=600 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-267772 class=wp-caption-text>Neilson Barnard/Getty Images</p><h2 id=financial-amp-legal-problems><strong>Financial & Legal Problems</strong></h2><p>Tyga has experienced a number of financial and tax issues over the years.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In 2011 Tyga rented a property in Malibu that cost him $16,000 per month. The landlord of the property, Gholamreza Rezai, sued the rapper in 2012, naming both the rapper and Tyga Music as defendants. The landlord claimed that the rapper signed a one year lease in June of 2011, but stopped paying rent in September of that year. The reason the rapper gave was that he was intending get out of the lease and leave the house that month because fans kept coming to the house. Still, a contract is a contract, and the landlord sued Tyga for the months of unpaid rent.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to unpaid rent, Rezai also wanted to be reimbursed for damage to the house caused by Tyga. According to court papers, Tyga apparently trashed the house. He reportedly ruined the house's hardwood floors, gate, and showers. He also added a stripper pole in the master bedroom and disconnected the home's intercom system. In total, the landlord sued Tyga for $480,000.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Tyga was scheduled to appear at a hearing in Santa Monica on August 8, 2016, but he failed to show. As a result, there an arrest warrant was issued</span>.</p><p>In September 2015, the state of California hit Tyga with a bill for $19,000 worth of unpaid taxes. A year earlier, the IRS hit Tyga with a $120,000 unpaid tax bill.</p><p>In late February 2016, it was reported that Tyga's G-Wagon was in the process of being repossessed. Tyga had reportedly not made payments in many months.</p><p>In April 2016 his Lamborghini Aventador and <span class=s1>2014 Bentley Mulsanne </span>were reportedly repossessed by a company called <span class=s1>Choice Motor Credit. Tyga reportedly owed exactly $357.350.77 on the Lamborghini.</span></p><p>In January 2019 Tyga's rented Maybach was repossessed. In March 2019 Tyga was sued by a rental car company for around $130,000 related to a 2012 Ferrari 458 Spider and a 2012 Rolls-Royce Ghost, leased by the rapper back in 2016, both of which had been repossessed.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293919 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/tg.png alt=Tyga width=758 height=591 sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293919 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=cash-money-royalties-lawsuit><strong>Cash Money Royalties Lawsuit</strong></h2><p>In August 2018 Tyga sued both Cash Money Records and its sub-label Young Money Entertainment over unpaid royalties. His lawsuit sought "no less than" $10 million in damages in order to be satisfied.</p><p>Tyga says that in 2009, he signed a deal to produce two albums for Young Money. Those two records, Hotel California and Careless World: Rise of the Last King were both financially successful, but Tyga says he was shorted by Young Money and its founder <a href=# title="Lil Wayne Net Worth">Lil Wayne</a> by "significant sums."</p><p>Tyga says he did sign a new agreement with Young Money and Cash Money to get him squared away and pay off the royalties he's owed, but then the labels allegedly continually refused to pay him anything.</p><h2 id=last-kings-lawsuit><strong>Last Kings Lawsuit</strong></h2><p>In June 2015 Tyga was sued by a woman named Chuon Guen Lee, who says that she formed the clothing line, <strong>Last Kings</strong>, with the rapper in January of 2013. Guen Lee says that the rapper made a promise to promote the brand and use his celebrity status to get the brand into popular chains such as Tilly's. Well, fast-forward to the present, and that never happened. And to add insult to injury, according to the lawsuit, Tyga stole merchandise worth&nbsp;<strong>half</strong><strong> a million</strong> dollars, and started his own company with another partner, Egypt Kings. Guen Lee is suing the California-bred rapper and Egypt Kings for <strong>$1.6 million</strong>.</p><p>In response to the lawsuit, a representative of Tyga said: "These, like other allegations, are completely false. This was a business relationship that went sour and was ended last year. We learned of the complaint via TMZ and are aware that individuals will continue to attempt to cash in on Tyga's success."</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-155942 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-451816723.jpg alt="FREDERIC J.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Tyga was born Micheal Ray Nguyen-Stevenson on November 19, 1989, in Los Angeles. Tyga is of Vietnamese and Jamaican descent. He was raised in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Compton until he was around 11 when he claims his family moved to the Los Angeles suburb of Gardena. We say he "claims" to have moved to Gardena, because back in December 2012, leaked footage from an unaired television show called "Bustas" which he filmed when he was 14. In the clip from the show, Tyga claimed to live in a "well-to-do" home in the San Fernando Valley and said his parents drove a Range Rover, rather than the poorer neighborhoods of Compton and Gardena.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-234017 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/GettyImages-531107714.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-234017 class=wp-caption-text>Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>"No Introduction" was released on June 10, 2008, and was Tyga's first independent album.

The lead single, "Deuces" peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop charts.</p><p>His second studio album "Careless World: Rise of the Last King: was released in February 2012. That album featured singles like the chart-topping &nbsp;"Rack City," "Faded," "Far Away" and "Make It Nasty." In March 2013, he released his third studio album titled "Hotel Californi" featuring well-established artists like <a href=# title="Rick Ross Net Worth">Rick Ross</a>, <a href=# title="Nicki Minaj Net Worth">Nicki Minaj</a>, Chris Brown, and <a href=# title="Wiz Khalifa Net Worth">Wiz Khalifa</a>. His fourth studio album "The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty" was released in June 2015 and sold just 5,000 records. He released a fifth album in July 2017 and a sixth album in February 2018. Despite his more recent sales slump, Tyga has sold more than 600,000 albums worldwide and 12 million digital singles. After a long period of poor sales and negative reviews for the album after album, Tyga's May 2018 single, "Taste," featuring Offset, peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100. This was his first Top 40 single since "Ayo" with Chris Brown in 2015. That single was the lead single for his seventh album "Legendary", which was released in June 2019.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-293920 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ty.jpg alt="Tyga Net Worth" width=900 height=657 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-293920 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Spotify)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In early October 2011, Tya attended Chris Brown's "F.A.M.E." tour after-party at the King of Diamonds club in Miami. He met Blac Chyna that night. They became an official couple a month later. Their son King Cairo Stevenson was born in October 2012. They got engaged in December 2012. They broke up in 2014.</p><p>Tyga and <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> dated for a number of years. They became official just days after Jenner's 18th birthday. However, the two had allegedly been dating since Jenner was 16. They split in April 2017.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-334189 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Tyga.jpg alt="Tyga Net Worth" width=900 height=951 sizes="(max-width: 1565px) 100vw, 1565px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-334189 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Francois Durand for Dior/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Over the years it was widely reported that Tyga owns a $6.5 million mansion in Calabasas, California. He reportedly bought it for <a href=#>Blac Chyna</a> when their son was born. This is not true. Tyga has lived in several mansions in Calabasas, California, but they were all rented.</p><p>Tyga has also not exactly been an ideal tenant in some of these houses. In June 2015, Tyga was sued by one of his former landlords for failing to pay $80,000 in rent. With penalties and interest, the amount owed was $124,000. In July 2015, Tyga was sued by a different landlord for falling behind on $50,000 worth of rent at another Calabasas house.</p><p>Tyga did finally buy a home in 2020 when he paid $3.9 million for a 5,700 square foot, lakefront home in Indio, California. Tyga put this mansion up fro sale in June 2023 for $5.9 million. He lowered the price to $5.5 million a month later. He accepted $5.1 million in August 2023. Interestingly, at the time of the sale, the property was listed on Zillow as being in "Pre-foreclosure" and when that message was expanded, it read: "<strong>The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on this property because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations.</strong>"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqzrc%2BpnKurX6nGqK2Mp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-proves-she-s-a-musical-genius-but-doesn-t-recognize-her-own-hit-song.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Proves Shes a Musical Genius But Doesnt Recognize Her Own Hit Song</span></a>
