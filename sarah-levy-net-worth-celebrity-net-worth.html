Sarah Levy is best known for playing Twyla Sands on the critically-acclaimed comedy series "Schitt's Creek" (2015‚Äì2020), which she starred on with her father and brother, who created the show.

In August 2020, it was announced that Levy and her "Schitt's Creek" co-star <a href=# title="Tim Rozon Net Worth">Tim Rozon</a> had been cast as series regulars on the Syfy drama "SurrealEstate."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Sarah Levy was born on September 10, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Her parents are actor/comedian <a href=#>Eugene Levy</a> and producer Deborah Divine, and her older brother is actor/writer <a href=#>Dan Levy</a>. Sarah attended Branksome Hall, then enrolled at Dalhousie University to study theatre. Since Eugene is Jewish and Deborah is Protestant, the Levy family celebrates Christmas and Hanukkah.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Sarah Levy was her father's assistant on the set of 2005's "Cheaper by the Dozen 2," and in 2011, she appeared in the film "Larry Crowne" and guest-starred on "XIII: The Series." She appeared in the short films "The Applicant" (2012) and "Roomies" (2013), then in 2014, she guest-starred on "Working the Engels" as Irene Horowitz, the daughter of Eugene's character, Arthur Horowitz. In 2015, Sarah began playing Caf√© Tropical waitress (and later owner) Twyla Sands on "Schitt's Creek," and she went on to appear in 63 episodes over six seasons.</p><p>Though Eugene and Dan played father and son Johnny and David Rose on the show, Sarah has said that she was happy to play a character that wasn't a member of the Rose family, stating, "When the show first came out, everyone assumed I was the sister. I love that that wasn't the case, because it has fully removed me from the hubbub of Daniel and Dad being father and son onscreen. I loved that people didn't know that I was related in any way, because I was able to do my own thing." While staring on "Schitt's Creek," Levy guest-starred on "Baroness Von Sketch Show" (2016) and "United We Fall" (2020) and appeared in the short film "The Winner Mindset" (2019) and the TV movie "Best Intentions" (2019).
