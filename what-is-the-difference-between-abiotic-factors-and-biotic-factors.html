Biotic describes a living component of an ecosystem; for example organisms, such as plants and animals. All living things — autotrophs and heterotrophs — plants, animals, fungi, bacteria.Click to see full answer. In this regard, what is the difference between abiotic and biotic factors?Abiotic factors refer to non-living factors such as water and air. The amount of precipitation in an ecosystem is another example of an abiotic factor. Biotic factors are living things. For example, plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and etc may all be components of your ecosystem and they are all living.Furthermore, can abiotic and biotic factors affect one another? Abiotic factors are all of the non-living things in an ecosystem. Both biotic and abiotic factors are related to each other in an ecosystem, and if one factor is changed or removed, it can affect the entire ecosystem. Also know, what are 3 biotic and abiotic factors? Biotic factors include animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and protists. Some examples of abiotic factors are water, soil, air, sunlight, temperature, and minerals.What is the similarity between biotic and abiotic factors?Biotic factors are all of the living things in an ecosystem, and as such are composed of cells, and include decomposers, producers, and consumers. Abiotic factors are all of the non-living things in an eccosystem, are not made of cells, and include such substances as soil, rocks, water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn5qsXZ7AbsDHnmSdoZabsrOxzZycZpqVqcSmsc1mmJuhn6m2pHnFmpqtp6KoeqK6w2aZoqeknrBussCcq6iqo2J%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-nathaniel-in-disenchanted.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Nathaniel in Disenchanted?</span></a>
