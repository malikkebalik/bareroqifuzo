It has been reported on by sites like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FandomWire</a>, and, while the first lines of their piece on the creation make it clear it is not real and Mahershala Ali is still on track to play the character whenever the movie manages to get made for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, some without media literacy believe it is real.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Will Smith playing Blade????

Here, the 54-year-old easily looks like he could also be a part of one of the Matrix films or a part of a newer gritty take on content he has been in like Suicide Squad or the Men in Black movies. While suggestions on a certain actor playing a certain role usually draw in some supporters who say it could work, here, this has not happened yet and hate is high.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/II_501_II/status/1673508364955836417</figure><p data-characters=471 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>Whether Smith (who was once afraid to act with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RuPaul</a>) would ever stretch himself this way or will get the opportunity to remains to be seen. Since his incident at the Oscars with Chris Rock, he only has released the made-before-the-incident Emancipation and only has an untitled fourth film in the Bad Boys series on deck. Some in the industry have <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he has ‚Äúno chance‚Äù of a future like the highs he once enjoyed, but, people are starting to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">come around</a>.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>For now, all anyone can do is wait and see. Smith is currently producing Bel-Air on TV and the Blade movie with Mahershala Ali is scheduled for Valentine‚Äôs Day 2025. Little is known about its story and it will feature Mia Goth, Delroy Lindo, and Aaron Pierre.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqKknGLArrXToWSmmaKrsq15zKitop1dq7azrctmrqKknGLArrXToWSbpJGZsm6t0a1knrCgoa6qusSdZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-monse-and-cesar-became-the-least-favorite-characters.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>How Monse and Cesar Became the Least Favorite Characters</span></a>
