She has, however, been spotted out with and attending functions alongside the wives of some of Vasilevskiy’s teammates including Anastasia Kucherov, who is married to Nikita Kucherov.</p><p id=par-7_54>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heavy.com</a>, it’s believed that Vasilevskaya had a modeling career before she and Vasilevskiy got together.

The goaltender knew he was getting called up to the NHL and figured that was the news he was going to hear.</p><p id=par-10_12>“I said, ‘No, you’re a new dad,'” Zettler recalled. “Even better news.”</p><p id=par-11_24>Vasilevskiy loves being a husband and parent and has stated that his family and hockey are the things that matter to him the most.</p><p id=par-12_39>“There’s probably guys my age like to go to bars or somewhere else, but not me.
