Just like he’s the president of the country they have presidents of companies.”</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>He goes on to say that if Trump doesn’t have to take a mugshot then an “80-year-old woman” accused of manslaughter for killing her husband after a fight shouldn’t have to either.”</p><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Vlad said the rationale for not giving Trump a mugshot is because the purpose of a mugshot is so the person can be identified if they go on the lam. “It’s designed to be posted for authorities to find that person.” Everyone already knows what Donald Trump looks like, he said. Boosie offered a rebuttal:</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>“Bill Cosby not recognizable? Mike Tyson’s not recognizable?” Hatch gets a little heated when he says the next thing: “Tupac’s not f**king recognizeable? That’s bulls**t.”</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>He goes on to say that nobody with stature should have to get a mugshot. “It’s called innocent until proven guilty.” He also claims that a mugshot will influence someone’s opinion on the crime and make them assume the person is guilty. “It should not be released until you are found guilty.”</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>Hatch knows a thing or two about guilty before proven innocent. In 2010 he was accused of first-degree murder, and in 2012 he was found not guilty of that crime. He did serve five years for drug charges, from which he was released in 2014.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>MUGSHOTS SHOULDNT BE RELEASED UNTIL YOU R FOUND GUILTY OF THE CRIME YOU Cb CHARGED WITH ‼️<a href=#>#politicians</a> THIS SHOULD BE A LAW‼️IT MAKES TOO MANY PEOPLE GUILTY BEFORE BEING PROVEN INNOCENT</p>— Boosie BadAzz (@BOOSIEOFFICIAL) <a href=#>April 5, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>Who knows – maybe the law will change.
