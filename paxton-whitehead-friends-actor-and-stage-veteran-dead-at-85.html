However, he had been in the industry for a long time before that. He started acting in 1956, at the age of 17, touring theaters with small companies and working his way up to Broadway by the ’60s. He worked on a total of 17 Broadway productions and, on top of this, he was also a theater director and playwright.</p><p>In the ’90s, Whitehead saw mainstream recognition for his role in the hit sitcom <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mad About You</a> among other shows, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ellen,</a> 3rd Rock from the Sun, and of course, Friends. His other credits include Back to School, The Duke and Kate and Leopold in which he starred alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugh Jackman</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Meg Ryan.</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tributes have been pouring in on Twitter</a> from fans of the actor as one fan wrote:</p><p>“R.I.P., Paxton Whitehead, who I’m sure was a delightful man in real life but as an actor found his niche by being exemplary at playing stiff British jerks and blowhards in projects like Back to School, Mad About You, and Friends.”</p><p>Many others had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">similar words of kindness</a> to say about the late legend.</p><p>“RIP to the great actor Paxton Whitehead……</p><p>He did all the great style of acting that you would expect from great British actors but we all know him from one role….</p><p>Thornton Melon’s nemesis Phillip on Back to School…..”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tributes also came in from fellow actors who had worked with him</a> both in front of the cameras and on stage.</p><p>“Heartbroken to hear my dear friend and mentor Paxton Whitehead has passed away.</p><p>He was an extraordinary actor, a brilliant friend, and truly wonderful human being.</p><p>He meant so much to so many people and always brought a smile to the faces of everyone he encountered.”</p><p>I’ve just heard that my beloved friend Paxton Whitehead&nbsp; has died, on Friday the 16th. We first worked together in “My Fair Lady” in 1964, and the last time was in “Importance of Being Earnest” in 2010 — friends for 59 years. I loved him so. Heartbroken.💔</p><p>Whitehead has left quite a large legacy behind; his body of work stretches pretty wide in all kinds of different roles from Friends to My Fair Lady. Whitehead is survived by his two children Charles and Alex.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S9osTTqKVmr5iewaa0xJqbZp6inrKvsNJmmJysn6d6orrDZqqtmZeaerex056pmqZdmbKisIyaq2ZwZWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lana-rhoades-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lana Rhoades Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
