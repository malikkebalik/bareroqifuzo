It was one time that Cassie mentioned inside her lawsuit where she said she had to go over to the London hotel. I was the one who was checking on her every day at the London hotel, you know what I’m saying? So, I know that to be true. I seen him getting into some rustling and punching matches, and sometimes, I felt like, what are you mad at? What are you upset about? Because it’s a deeper anger when you hitting and punching a woman in that type of manner.”</p><p id=par-7_49>As for Combs’ behavior toward Porter, Bonds noted that he saw Combs “grab her up” inside of a car. “I seen him smack her, you know?” Bonds said. “One thing about Kim is, Kim got to the point where she fought back because she realized how powerful she was.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-roger-bonds-talked-about-kim-attitude-and-what-he-witnessed-between-the-couple>Roger Bonds talked about ‘Kim attitude’ and what he witnessed between the couple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sean-P.-Diddy-Combs-Kim-Porter.jpg><p id=par-8_52>While speaking to Piers Morgan, Roger Bonds described a specific incident he witnessed between Sean “P. Diddy” Combs and Kim Porter. He described an incident on Sunset Boulevard in front of The Beverly Hills Hotel, where he saw Combs and Porter’s car “rocking back and forth,” so he opened the car door.</p><p id=par-9_67>“I said, ‘What are you doing? What are you doing? You see where we at? What are you doing?'” Bonds said of Combs. “And Kim got out the car like nothing happened, and she fixed her hair, and she told him. She said, ‘I want to see you explain to the media that scratch I’mma put across your face if you put your hands on me again.”</p><p id=par-10_37>“That was Kim attitude,” Bonds added. “Kim attitude was, she realized that what he had to explain meant more to him than anything, and once she realized she had that power, she said, nah, not no more.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-donald-trump-jr-s-ex-wife-said-kim-porter-feared-sean-p-diddy-combs>Donald Trump Jr.’s ex-wife said Kim Porter feared Sean ‘P.
