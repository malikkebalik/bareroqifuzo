Stephen Baldwin has had a decidedly strange acting career.&nbsp; After choosing to follow in the footsteps of his actor brothers, Alec, Daniel, and William, his star seemed on the rise.&nbsp; After appearing in guest starring roles on a number of late 80s and early 90s sitcoms, including "Kate and Allie" and "Family Ties", he transitioned to film work.&nbsp; Some of his early projects included roles in "Born on the Fourth of July", "Posse", "8 Seconds", "Threesome", "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle", and his most well reviewed performance, as McManus, in "The Usual Suspects".&nbsp; Then it all kind of went "pear-shaped".&nbsp; His film projects became increasingly low budget, or just plain destined for poor reviews, and in 2006, he and his family found it necessary to sell their home.&nbsp; By 2009, the home had been foreclosed upon, and they had been forced to declare bankruptcy.&nbsp; Already a celebrity reality series veteran by the mid-2000s, with appearances on such shows as "Celebrity Mole Hawaii" and "Celebrity Mole Yucatan", he would spend the next few years focusing on the reality television work.&nbsp; He has since appeared on "<a href=# title="Ty Murray Net Worth">Ty Murray</a>'s Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge", "Celebrity Apprentice", "I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!", and "Celebrity Big Brother (UK)".</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Stephen Baldwin was born Stephen Andrew Baldwin on May 12, 1966, in Massapequa, New York. He grew up in a Catholic household with mother Carol, father Alexander (a teacher and football coach), brothers <a href=#>Alec</a>, <a href=#>William</a>, and <a href=#>Daniel</a>, and sisters Jane and Elizabeth. As a high school student, Stephen joined the varsity wrestling team, and after graduation, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Baldwin made his acting debut in a 1987 episode of the PBS anthology series "American Playhouse," and the following year, he guest-starred on "Family Ties" and appeared in the films "Homeboy" and "The Beast." In1989, he began starring in the western TV series "The Young Riders," appearing in 67 episodes over three seasons.

In the 1990s, he starred in 20 films, including "Crossing the Bridge" (1992), "A Simple Twist of Fate" (1994), "Half Baked" (1998), and "Friends & Lovers" (1999).

He hosted eight episodes of the Syfy channel hidden camera show "Syfy" in 2004, and he also directed and co-produced the documentary short "Livin' It" that year.</p><p>In 2007, Stephen appeared as himself in the <a href=# title="Vince Vaughn Net Worth">Vince Vaughn</a>-Paul <a href=# title="Paul Giamatti Net Worth">Paul Giamatti</a> holiday film "Fred Claus" and was cast on "Ty Murray's Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge," but he dropped out in the second episode after he fell from a wooden pontoon and ended up with a broken shoulder blade and cracked rib. In 2008, he came in fifth place on "Celebrity Apprentice," and competed on "All-Star Celebrity Apprentice" in 2013. Baldwin produced and directed the documentary "The Will to Drill" in 2012, and in recent years, he has appeared in numerous religious films, such as "I'm in Love with a Church Girl" (2013), "Faith of Our Fathers" (2015), and "The Apostle Peter: Redemption" (2016). In 2019, he portrayed real-life missionary Graham Staines in "The Least of These: The Graham Staines Story," and he has starred in several made-for-television movies, including "Cutaway" (2000), "Jesse Stone: Night Passage" (2006), and "Harpies" (2007).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-311345 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Stephen-Baldwin-2.jpg alt width=900 height=615 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-311345 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=financial-issues><strong>Financial issues</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Stephen's home in Rockland County, New York (which he purchased for $515,000 in 1997) was auctioned in foreclosure after he defaulted on more than $800,000 worth of mortgage payments. It was also revealed at the time that he owed tens of thousands in state and federal taxes on the property. Baldwin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July 2009. His court filing claimed that the actor had several million dollars' worth of debt. In 2013, Stephen was ordered to pay $300,000 worth of back taxes and penalties after pleading guilty to failing to file New York state income taxes for three consecutive years (2008, 2009, and 2010).</p><h2 id=activism><strong>Activism</strong></h2><p>Baldwin became a born-again Christian after the 2001 September 11th attacks, and in 2006, he founded Breakthrough Ministry with Bobby Brewer and Mario D'Ortenzio. The organization staged arena tours (AsSalt Tours) to reach people through extreme sports. Two years later, Stephen launched Antioch Ministry, a for-profit organization meant to "facilitate the gifts and calling of Stephen Baldwin" and reach young people "with a culturally relevant presentation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ." He formed another ministry, Now More Than Ever, in 2009, which was dedicated to reaching people that were enlisted in the military all over the world.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-263497 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Stephen-Baldwin.jpg alt="Stephen Baldwin Net Worth" width=594 height=407 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-263497 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Stephen married Kennya Deodato, a Brazilian graphic designer, on June 10, 1990, and they welcomed daughters Alaia and <a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a> in 1993 and 1996, respectively. Baldwin is the father-in-law of musician <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a>, who married Hailey in 2018. Stephen got an "HM" tattoo on his shoulder after <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus Net Worth">Miley Cyrus</a> dared him to, saying that he could appear on "Hannah Montana" (which his daughters were fans of) if he went through with it. Though he showed Cyrus the tattoo at a 2008 book signing, he never appeared on the show.</p><h2 id=kevin-costner-lawsuit><strong>Kevin Costner Lawsuit</strong></h2><p>In 2010, Baldwin <a href=#>sued Kevin Costner for $3.8 million</a> over oil-separating technology that was developed by <a href=#>Kevin's Costner</a> in Nevada Corporation (CINC). According to Stephen, he and Costner had made an agreement that Baldwin and friend Spyridon Contogouris would be allowed to market the technology to BP after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, but Kevin met with BP without them. Stephen alleged that Costner used the $18 million down payment that BP agreed to in that meeting to buy Baldwin and Contogouris out, resulting in the two men having to give up $2 million of their shares in the enterprise just before BP paid $52 million for the CINC technology. A jury voted in Costner's favor in June 2012.</p><h2 id=awards-nominations><strong>Awards and Nominations</strong></h2><p>In 1995, Baldwin shared an Awards Circuit Community Award and a National Board of Review award with his "The Usual Suspects" castmates. He also received a Stinker Award for Worst On-Screen Hairstyle for "Biodome" in 1996. Stephen was nominated for a DVD Exclusive Award for Best Actor for "Slap Shot 2: Breaking the Ice" in 2003, and "The Flyboys" earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 2008 Hoboken International Film Festival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZMC1sc%2BhnKdlkpa5pcPIp2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lee-shau-kee-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Lee Shau Kee Net Worth</span></a>
