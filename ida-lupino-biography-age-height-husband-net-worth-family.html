The trailer for that film, "The Parallel Universe of Noir," concludes with the same house, followed by director Jordan Mohr setting up a shot. (An earlier Lupino residence, Ravenswood Apartments, is also shown in "Hollywood Mouth 3.").</p><p>Her image appears on the cover of the music CD Electro Swing VIII released in 2015.</p><p>Profiled in "Killer Tomatoes: Fifteen Tough Film Dames" bu Ray Hagen and Laura Wagner (McFarland, 2004).</p><p>Musician <a href=#>Paul Bley</a> recorded a song in honor of her entitled "Ida Lupino", composed by his then-wife Carla Bley, for his 1965 album "Closer".</p><p><a href=#>Richard Boone</a> told columnist <a href=#>Erskine Johnson</a> in 1961 about her skills as a director, "Ida stimulates me as an actor because she knows acting. In a weekly show, you get into acting patterns. Ida gets you out of them.".</p><p>She was the only person to both appear in and direct episodes of The Twilight Zone (1959), acting in The Twilight Zone: The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine (1959) and directing The Twilight Zone: The Masks (1964). She was also the only woman to have directed an episode of the series.</p><p>Although accomplished as both a director and an actress, she preferred to keep these two functions separate, with The Bigamist (1953) being the exception in which she both starred and directed.</p><p>At age 34, Lupino gave birth to her only child, a daughter Bridget Mirella Duff (aka Bridget Duff) on April 23, 1952. Bridget's father was Lupino's third husband, actor <a href=#>Howard Duff</a>. <a href=#>Bridget Duff</a> weighed only 4 pounds at birth and almost died.</p><p>Became lifelong friends with <a href=#>Mala Powers</a> (whom she directed in Outrage (1950)). When Lupino died in 1995, Powers was named the executor of her estate. Lupino was interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.</p><p>Her first directing job came when director <a href=#>Elmer Clifton</a> fell ill on a script that she co-wrote Not Wanted (1949). Ida had joked that as an actress, she was the poor man's Bette Davis. Now, she said that as a director, she became the poor man's Don Siegel. The films that she wrote, or directed, or appeared in during the fifties were mostly inexpensive melodramas.</p><p>She left Warner Brothers in 1947 and became a freelance actress. When better roles did not materialize, Ida stepped behind the camera as a director, writer and producer.</p><p>She made a handful of films during the forties playing different characters ranging from Pillow to Post (1945), where she played a traveling saleswoman to the tough nightclub singer in The Man I Love (1946). But good roles for women were hard to get and there were many young actresses and established stars competing for those roles.</p><p>Lupino was originally scheduled to play Cassandra Tower in Kings Row (1942), but when Warner Brothers decided to loan her to 20th Century-Fox for two films, she was replaced by <a href=#>Betty Field</a>.</p><p>In The Sea Wolf (1941) and High Sierra (1941), she played the part magnificently. It has been said that no one could do hard-luck dames the way Lupino could do them. She played tough, knowing characters who held their own against some of the biggest leading men of the day - Humphrey Bogart, Ronald Colman, John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson.</p><p>Peter Ibbetson (1935) was one of her few noteworthy movies and it was not until The Light That Failed (1939) that she got a chance to get better parts. In most of her movies, she was cast as the hard, but sympathetic woman from the wrong side of the tracks.</p><p>Ida, a bleached blonde, came to Hollywood in 1934 and played small and insignificant parts.</p><p>Arrived in the U.S. from England aboard the RMS Berengaria at New York on August 25, 1933 at age 15. At age ten, Lupino asked her father to construct a theater for her and her sister. The project resulted in an elaborate structure with electrical equipment, a pit, and seating for a hundred.</p><p>Ida was born in London to a show business family. In 1932, her mother brought Ida with her to an audition and Ida got the part her mother wanted.</p><p>The picture was Her First Affaire (1932).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnrGiecuup6Kmnw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-andrea-mychaels-die-dance-educator-and-choreographer-passed-away-a-dance-luminary-remember.html><span>←</span><span>How Did Andrea Mychaels Die?
