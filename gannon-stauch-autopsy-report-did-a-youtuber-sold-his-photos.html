He was a good-time youngster. He loved making jokes. He cherished nice times. Know all details about Gannon Stauch’s autopsy below.</p><h2>Gannon Stauch Autopsy Report</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gannon-Stauch-Autopsy.webp><p><strong>A broadcaster of NewsNation has criticized a YouTuber for posting a video that features autopsy photographs of kἰlled Colorado teenager Gannon Stauch.</strong></p><p>In January 2020, Gannon, age 11, was murdered by his stepmother Letecia Stauch. She was found guilty of two charges of murder in May of this year and given a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release. Prosecutors said that Letecia Stauch stἀbbed and sh0t her stepson 18 times. <a href=# rel=noopener>Gannon was shot in the head</a>, fracturing his skull, and dying.</p><p>The prosecution claimed that before taking the boy’s body to Florida, Letecia Stauch abandoned it near the intersection of Colorado State Highway 105 and South Perry Park Road.</p><p>Brian Entin has expressed his empathy for victims of people who exploit their grief for financial benefit. He stated that true-crime YouTuber Zav Girl was guilty of that very thing.</p><p>Entin elaborated by saying the YouTuber was selling the autopsy photos of Stauch after showing them in a video she made for her Patreon patrons.</p><p>On Tuesday (11 July),<a href=# rel=noopener> Zav Girl released a message on her channel</a> where she protested against this assertion. She clarified that she was not selling Stauch images individually, but rather had released a full film for patrons exclusively.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gannon-Stauch.webp><p>Images and testimony from the homicide trial were the primary focus. Patreons can pay a monthly subscription to support their favorite creators on Patreon and have access to exclusive content that might not make it onto the creator’s public YouTube channel otherwise.</p><p>“I get that some of you are upset that I’m asking for donations to see the video on my Patreon. In her message, Zav Girl implied that she could understand the criticism if she were charging separately for the autopsy files.”</p><p>“But in this case I spent a lot of time and worked hard putting together a video lining up the coroner’s audio and descriptions along with the appropriate part of the photos she is describing and editing it together to try to make it as informative as possible for the viewer,” the YouTuber added.</p><p>Entin tweeted excerpts of his on-air discussion of the autopsy dispute on Tuesday. Both the YouTuber’s remark and her decision to upload the autopsy photographs were disregarded by him. The NewsNation reporter claimed to have been personally offended and disgusted by Zav Girl’s behavior.</p><p><strong>You can read out the tweet of Brian Entin below:</strong></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>1/4<br>YouTuber charged people to see gruesome autopsy photos of 11-year-old Gannon Stauch. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/O3XtQrOh0Y</a></p><p>— Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 12, 2023</a></p><p><strong>Entin added-</strong></p><p>“Zav Girl thought it would be a good idea to put in a Freedom of Information (FOI) request for little 11-year-old Gannon’s autopsy photos and they actually released the photos to her.”</p><p>You may probably guess from the description of the small boy’s murder how much money she paid to get the images released to her.</p><p><strong>Afterward, Entin explained-</strong></p><p>“Zav Girl posted them on her Patreon account, an account attached to her YouTube page, and she charged her followers money to see the autopsy photos.”</p><p>You may pay $3 to see tiny Gannon’s dead body. She was profiting from the sale of the autopsy pictures of the small kid. The internet is not the appropriate place for autopsy photographs of a severely beaten child.</p><p>Michael Allen, the main prosecutor in the murder case, confirmed to Entin that Gannon’s family is aware of the controversy. Allen further elaborated that he had given the family advice on how to deal with this occurrence, but that there was nothing that could be done to remove the photos from the internet.</p><p>And Gannon deserves respect and dignity in death even more than he had from his stepmother in life. Nothing about this YouTuber’s actions (and those of another who may exist) is respectful or fitting toward Gannon. Allen has remarked that the official statement released to explain the situation rings false.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We have made this article for information content only.
