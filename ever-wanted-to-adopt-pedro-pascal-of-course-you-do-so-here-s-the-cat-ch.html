Have you seen him dance? The internet has dubbed him ‚ÄòDaddy,‚Äô but we‚Äôd argue that Pascal is more akin to a soft, adorable kitten. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to adopt Pedro Pascal (and we know you have, don‚Äôt lie), you‚Äôre in luck. While we can‚Äôt offer you the Chilean-born hunk himself, we have an enticing alternative.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>The Kansas Humane Society, located in Wichita, Kansas, has been helping abandoned and homeless animals for over 130 years. And guess what? It‚Äôs giving you the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to adopt a Pedro. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedro Pspspscal</a>, the little furball who‚Äôs taking over social media one meow at a time, is currently up for adoption.</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>This two-year-old Domestic Shorthair / Mix was admitted to the KHS on March 9, 2023, and has yet to be adopted. But we‚Äôre certain that with Pedro going viral as fast as he is, someone is bound to snatch him up sooner or later. Live in the Kansas area or nearby? That special someone could be you!</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>The KHS even decided to promote Pedro Pspspscal‚Äôs adoption page by sharing a hilarious selection of images on Twitter that digitally overlay the real Pedro Pascal‚Äôs face with that of his feline counterpart. Suddenly, it isn‚Äôt so difficult to imagine the rough and ready Joel Miller as an adorable quadruped. What would that make Bella Ramsey? Bella Rameowsy? No, that‚Äôs terrible. Cut that.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Pedro Pspspscal is daddy and we all love this famous boi ‚ù§Ô∏è Here‚Äôs some of his most famous scenes with costars Bella Ramsey, Grogu, and Nicolas Cage üôåüèΩ <a href=#>#adoptdontshop</a> <a href=#>#pedropascal</a></p><p>Pedro Pspspscal: <a href=#>https://t.co/bLPIVbCmab</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bEz751YVpo</a></p>‚Äî Kansas Humane Society (@kshumanesociety) <a href=#>March 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>It doesn‚Äôt take much to entertain the internet nowadays, but the KHS seemed to achieve its goal of attracting attention for Pedro, who soon went viral after the memes made the rounds on Twitter. Plenty of commenters responding positively, stuck between finding the unconventional name both a clever play on words and utterly ridiculous in the best way possible.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Been laughing about this for about 5 consecutive minutes <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QzqI1LgndL</a></p>‚Äî Kalon Fullerton (@cowlonfull) <a href=#>March 20, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=false>Probably like the real Pedro Pascal, if you love him, feed him, and love him forever, he‚Äôll be your best friend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8psLEq2SwmZ6psqV506hkmpyfpcFuvMSdqahloJbApK3LZqafZZOkwrO%2FxGawqK1dmbxuv85mn56qlah6tbTEZpqarJOdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-micro-pigs-climb-stairs.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Can micro pigs climb stairs?</span></a>
