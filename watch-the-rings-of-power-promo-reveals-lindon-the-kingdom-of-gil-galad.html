That peace is only the calm before the storm, however, as the Enemy of the Free Peoples is anything but vanquished.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=623 data-injectable=true>Sauron the Deceiver is stirring again, with the breath of his Shadow threatening to overwhelm all else in Middle-earth and bring about an era of darkness much like his former master, Morgoth, did thousands of years ago. That’s where Galadriel, now under the moniker of Commander of the Armies of the North, comes into the fold.</p><p data-characters=304 data-current-count=304 data-injectable=false>The heroine will be seeking out Sauron throughout Middle-earth, a journey that will take him to the very doorsteps of Númenor. Before all of that, audiences will be shown Lindon, where they’ll visit Gil-galad, Elrond, and presumably Celebrimbor, the legendary blacksmith who forged the rings of power.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lord-of-the-rings-scaled.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lord-of-the-rings2-scaled.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>The Rings of Power, debuting with a two-episode premiere on Sept. 1, will deal with the cataclysmic events of the Second Age, including the war against Sauron, the forging of the rings of power, the downfall of Númenor, and the War of the Last Alliance, few glimpses of which we saw during Peter Jackson’s prologue to The Fellowship of the Ring.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=251 data-injectable=false>Lindon will be one of the many places that Amazon Studios has created as part of their immersive take on Middle-earth, and we can’t wait for the producers to show even more of what they’ve been working on behind the scenes for the past five years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4rdOcn2asmJp6s7XNoKpmp5ZivbDDxKtkqaqforxuvsSvnJqko2K5qrrDqKVmrJiaeqy1zaCbqKVdpLNus8ilZKCZnJaxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-mcnary-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Josh McNary Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
