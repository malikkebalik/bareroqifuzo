Baker Mayfield has had a bit of a rollercoaster career in the NFL. The Cleveland Browns selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in 2018, and after a 2020 campaign that included a playoff victory over the rival Pittsburgh Steelers, it looked like the Browns had found a franchise quarterback. Instead, Mayfield struggled the following year, and the Browns traded for Deshaun Watson before the 2022 season. Cleveland also gifted Watson a $230 million fully guaranteed deal, a decision that has not aged well.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mark Cuban Is Selling The Dallas MavericksWhile Still Retaining Control Of The Team</h2><time>Sep 19, 2024</time>
