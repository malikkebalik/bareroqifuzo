The way John Mayer uses Twitter, you’d think he would have nothing but high praise for the social networking phenomenon."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The man is easily the most famous Twitter addicts out there. Yet he just told E! that he thinks it’s “silly” and “dumb.” This is the same guy <a href=#>who was actually broken up with because of his Twitter obsession</a>. John claims he just uses it because everyone else does. Smart.</p><p>The way John Mayer uses Twitter, you’d think he would have nothing but high praise for the social networking phenomenon.</p><p>But no, the singer actually has some harsh words for the latest in social messaging.</p><p>“It’s inherently silly and it’s inherently dumb,” the singer told me last night at the One Splendid Evening benefit for the VH1 Save the Music Foundation aboard the Carnival Splendor cruise ship in San Pedro, Calif. “If you really think that Twitter is the pathway to spiritual enlightenment, well…It’s one step away from sending pictures of your poop.”</p><p>So why does the Grammy-winner twitter all the time?</p><p>“I’ve always communicated at a high level as best I can whether it’s Twitter, Napster or message boards or wherever,” Mayer said. “I don’t have a devotion to Twitter. I didn’t sell out to Twitter. You do Twitter until everybody gets off of Twitter and it’s something else you go and try out.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>E! News</a>]</p><p>“‘It’s one step away from sending pictures of your poop.’” So I’m assuming it’s safe to say John’s sent a lot of pictures of his bathroom accomplishments. Good to know. Now if I could only stick his head in the toilet bowl and give him a swirly, I could accurately demonstrate exactly how I feel about the guy.</p><p>So John’s claiming he doesn’t actually like Twitter. And he only uses it because that’s what’s popular right now. I have easily gone off on ten Twitter rants in the last three days. I don’t like it. Yet all of my friends are using it. But I manage to actually have my own – albeit minority – opinion, and my actions fall in line with it. Meaning I dislike Twitter and think it’s stupid and dumb, thus I don’t use it. Seems rational, right? You don’t have to agree with me that it’s stupid and dumb, but it makes sense that if I think so, I wouldn’t tweet. Or whatever the jargon is. Yet here’s John Mayer saying the same damn thing, however he’s still on there fifteen times a day.</p><p>I’ll resist making a bunch of sheep noises.</p><p>Here’s John Mayer at ‘One Splendid Evening’ sponsored by Carnival Cruise Lines and benefiting VH1 Save The Music Foundation held at Port Of Los Angeles last night.
