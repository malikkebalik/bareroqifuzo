As the war intensifies, and the refugee crisis and casualty numbers grow, many celebrities have voiced their concern.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_33>Noah believes some of the artists taking the 2022 Grammy stage may want to speak up about the Ukrainian war. The 38-year-old expects a few to voice their political views during the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_59>“I think the show is going to find the right place and the right space to do something,” he told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Associated Press</a>. “It’s one of those interesting balances in life we try to achieve, which is acknowledging what’s happening in the world whilst allowing yourself the grace to celebrate some of the moments that are also going on.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2><strong>But ‘The Daily Show’ host suggests it’s OK to ‘take a break’ and celebrate</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_37>As host of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Daily Show</a>, Noah makes cultural and political commentary about world affairs every night. But when talking to the Associated Press, the Grammy host admitted that while difficult, it’s still important to recognize achievements.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_46>“I think it’s also important for us to be able to take a break from everything,” Noah suggested. “That’s the ultimate quandary we face. Is it important to highlight issues around the world? Definitely. It’s also important to celebrate things that are happening in the world.”</p><p id=par-7_22>The 64th Annual Grammy Awards are being held in Las Vegas. Noah thinks it’s the perfect place to bring artists together again.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-8_59>“I think it’s going to be a celebration of an industry coming back to life,” he said. “I think a lot of the artists will enjoy Vegas. Nobody lives there. There’s an element of this [show] that’s like a music camp. I think it’s going to bring a different energy, and I’m excited to be a part of it.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>This is the second time Trevor Noah will host the Grammys</strong></h2><p id=par-9_21>Noah <a href=#>hosted the Grammy Awards in 2021</a>. But due to the pandemic, that show featured less crowded outdoor and pre-taped performances.</p><p id=par-10_35>With coronavirus restrictions easing, this year’s ceremony will include a live audience. Hosting the show once again, Noah admits the live element will “bring in an energy” while sacrificing “a little bit of that intimacy.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_47>“But it’s nice to have fans cheering for their favorite artist,” he said in his chat with the Associated Press. “It’s nice to see the performances because one of the biggest reasons the Grammys is my favorite award show is that it is a live music festival.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_38>The <a href=#>2022 Grammy Awards</a> will feature performances from some of the biggest names in music, including BTS, Lil Nas X, and Billie Eilish.&nbsp; The show is scheduled to air Sunday, April 3 at 8:00 p.m. EST on CBS.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2FcX6RZp6rmZ2ixrR5x6iqrWWkp7K3u9FmpaiZmGKyubzEnKusZZGnwaq%2F06xkoJ2kYr2wuMitoJyZnGO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./smoke-s-poutinerie-ceo-ryan-smolkin-dead-at-50.html><span>←</span><span>Smokes Poutinerie CEO Ryan Smolkin dead at 50</span></a>
