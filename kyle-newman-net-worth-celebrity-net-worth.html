They would go on to have two children together.</p><p>In 2020, King filed for divorce from Newman and also obtained a temporary restraining order against him.</p><p>In his own filing, Kyle claimed that she emptied the joint bank accounts, which could be potentially interpreted as financial misconduct and concealing assets. Kyle also claimed that she kicked him out of the family home with no access to their joint funds. Prior to the divorce, Kyle was apparently acting as a stay-at-home dad with King acting as the primary breadwinner.</p><p>He also accused her of being a chronic drug addict and an alcoholic. These kinds of accusations can have a serious effect on custody battles, as judges tend to keep children away from parents with substance abuse problems. Kyle even accused King of driving under the influence with her children in the car. Finally, he claimed that Jaime had admitted to having an affair during their marriage.</p><p>In April 2022 a judge ordered Jaime to pay Kyle $1,000 per month in spousal support. In October 2022 Kyle claimed in an LA court that Jaime had not been paying him the court-ordered monthly support. He further claimed that Jaime had emptied their retirement accounts, roughly $500,000 worth, and sold their primary residence generating $1.5 million in proceeds which he was not able to access. In his filing he requested $700,000 to cover his attorney's fees and his share of the home sale proceeds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7w6KpnpukpL%2B0e8qyo55lnprErq3NZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./couple-dropped-lawsuit-against-oceangate-s-ceo-for-not-refunding-them-for-canceled-trip-on-his-sub.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Couple dropped lawsuit against OceanGate's CEO for not refunding them for canceled trip on his sub,</span></a>
