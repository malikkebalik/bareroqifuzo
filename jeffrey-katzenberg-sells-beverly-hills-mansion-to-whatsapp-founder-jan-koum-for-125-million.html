In August he managed to sell his expansive Beverly Hills estate to WhatsApp founder <a href=#>Jan Koum</a> for $125 million in an all-cash deal.</p><p>That sum makes this number three on the list of the most expensive residential transaction in the history of the state of California (number one is the $165 million sale from <a href=#>David Geffen</a> to <a href=#>Jeff Bezos</a> while number two is a $150 million sale by film industry exec <a href=#>Lachlan Murdoch</a> which was carried out privately without any public listing).</p><p>The property boasts almost 27,000 square feet of living space, five bedrooms, and 13 (!) bathrooms. It's located in the exclusive Beverly Hills community of Trousdale Estates, where Koum will be right at home among other tech entrepreneurs like Uber co-founder <a href=#>Garrett Camp</a> and "Minecraft" creator <a href=#>Markus Persson</a>, both of whom reportedly have homes in the area.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308295 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1196237879.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308295 class=wp-caption-text>Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images</p><p>Unfortunately, details on the property are scarce owing to the fact that it was never publicly listed for sale. But an aerial photo taken of the property shows a distinctive U-shaped structure, an extremely long driveway, and plenty of lawn space.</p><p>Katzenberg purchased the property in 2009 for $35 million, but tore down the existing house and built the current one, designed by architect Howard Backen. Now, it joins two other expansive California estates to Koum's name. It took him about four years (and $57 million) to put together more than five and a half acres of land in Atherton, California, land on which he built a huge custom compound for a reported $20 million. One of this compound's most distinctive features is its 10,000 square-foot garage where he keeps his ever-growing collection of automobiles, with a focus on Porsches and Ferraris. That's all in addition to another Atherton property Koum purchased in 2015 for $8.8 million: a 3700-square-foot home that he still owns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeamrOnvsSyZKSZpK%2Byr67Eq55mq5WhubR5wZ6tnqqcrnqptculqmalkaPAqrvNZquoZaedrrW%2FwKmnZp6fqrulsdFmoZqmXaC8trmMn6arZWFngm65yKWjoqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edward-johnson-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Edward Johnson Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
