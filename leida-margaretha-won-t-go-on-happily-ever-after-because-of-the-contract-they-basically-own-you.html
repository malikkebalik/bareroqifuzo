Because the powers at be were like, ‘No, I’m not doing that.’ So the relationship is just kind of kept down low. We don’t really do much together,” Eric said in an interview with The Domenick Nati Show on July 4.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Eric and Leida on not being ’90 Day Fiancé’ fan favorites</h2><p id=par-4_25>Eric and Leida were not considered fan favorites among 90 Day Fiancé viewers. The controversial couple blames their lack of popularity on the editing.</p><p id=par-5_16>“If you go by the way they portrayed us, yeah, we’re horrible people,” said Eric.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_20>Leida went so far as to say that she and Eric are her least favorite 90 Day Fiancé couple.</p><p id=par-7_37>“Based on how they portrayed us, of course. We hate ourselves. I’m being serious. I hate myself! Every time I see myself on the show I look like either a pig or an a**hole,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>TLC wants Eric and Leida to be on ’90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?’</h2><p id=par-8_27>Despite not being well-liked among fans, Eric and Leida say TLC has asked them repeatedly to join the cast of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?</p><p id=par-9_19>“They keep asking me, they keep asking us, but no. We prefer to keep refusing them,” said Leida. &nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_31>While Eric has complained about how much 90 Day Fiancé cast-members get paid, he and Leida said the pay goes up on Happily Ever After, which is a bit more enticing.</p><p id=par-11_21>“Happily Ever After starts from $2,500. But you can negotiate. You can get $3,000 or $4,000 per person,” said Leida.</p><p id=par-12_29>Even so, Eric and Leida say they don’t want to be on Happily Ever After. So they made a counteroffer they were sure the network wouldn’t agree to.</p><p id=par-13_31>“We were like, ‘Alright, they must not want us that bad.’ We counteroffered with something that they couldn’t, that they wouldn’t do. Just so they’d stop asking us,” said Eric.</p><p id=par-14_12>The couple asked for $5,000 each per episode and a truck. &nbsp;</p><figure class="rt-ig-embed wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-15_21>“They were like, ‘No, we don’t do that.’ And I was like, ‘Alright, cool. Then leave us alone,’” said Eric.</p><p id=par-16_23>Leida said a big part of the reason she and Eric don’t want to go on Happily Ever After is the contract. &nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_14>“Once you sign for Happily Ever After, they basically own you,” she said.</p><p id=par-18_44>“They can draft you into any other season after that,” explained Eric. “Because once you sign that first Happily Ever After, it’s in there that they can pretty much pull you into anything they want. They own you for at least a while.”</p><p id=par-19_22>As for other 90 Day Fiancé shows, Eric says he’d be “OK with” doing Pillow Talk. But Leida isn’t so sure.</p><p id=par-20_16>We don’t know how they’re going to portray us,” she said. “We’ve been there, done that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKWcopyRYrqivsaaqZ6smJZ6uLvNrWSgp12ku260wKmnoqSpYrK3sdFmmJ%2Bslad6o7HCmqysnV2ks27Ax55knKeeqb%2Bir9Nmq6GdqWKvor%2FInJilpKlivLi6jLKmrmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeffrey-katzenberg-sells-beverly-hills-mansion-to-whatsapp-founder-jan-koum-for-125-million.html><span>←</span><span>Jeffrey Katzenberg Sells Beverly Hills Mansion To WhatsApp Founder Jan Koum For $125 Million</span></a>
