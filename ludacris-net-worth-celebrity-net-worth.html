Christopher "Ludacris" Bridges has quietly built one of the most successful cross-disciplinary careers in Hollywood. &nbsp;Always interested in music, he began rapping when he was in elementary school, and went on to major in Music Management at Georgia State University. &nbsp;His music career began to take over in the late 90s, and he left school early to begin work on his first album. &nbsp;His debut project, "Back for the First Time", spawned the hit tracks, "Southern Hospitality" and "What's Your Fantasy?", and helped introduce Atlanta's "Dirty South" sound, to a national audience. Since then, he has released several more albums, and launched a successful acting career, appearing in such projects as "2 Fast 2 Furious", "Crash", and "New Year's Eve", among other films. He has won Grammy Awards, a SAG Award, and is the co-founder of Disturbing Tha Peace Records.</p><h2 id=ludacris-money-problems><strong>Ludacris Money Problems?</strong></h2><p>In February of 2014 Ludacris was taken to court by a former girlfriend over child support payments. His former girlfriend, Tamika Fuller, was demanding $15,000 a month to help her raise their&nbsp; daughter Cai who was two years old at the time. Shockingly, Ludacris reported to the judge that he was struggling for money at the time. He reported that his entire income for the year 2013 was just $55,000 but he did reveal that in recent months his income had been around $26,o00. Ludacris also told the judge that he was expecting a big payday upcoming Fast and the Furious movies, but production had been halted at the time due to <a href=# title="Paul Walker Net Worth">Paul Walker</a>'s tragic death in December 2013.</p><p>Under Georgia law, the income of BOTH parents is taken into account when calculating support payments. Luda used this rule to argue that his total payment shouldn't have exceeded $1,800 a month. The judge ultimately ordered the payments to be $7,000 a month.</p><p>Over the next 18 months following the ruling, between August 2014 and August 2015, Ludacris ended up earning approximately <strong>$8 million</strong> from his various acting and musical endeavors.</p><h2 id=private-jet><strong>Private Jet</strong></h2><p>Ludacris has been fascinated by flying for many years and at some point even got his pilot's license. He has owned several private jets over the course of his career. One of his private jets was a Hawker 700 that was worth between $900,000 and $1.5 million. In May 2022 Ludacris announced over Instagram that <a href=#>he had purchased a major private jet upgrade</a>. His new jet was a 14-passenger, 1984 Dassault Falcon 900 that cost $3 -4 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><b>Early Life</b></h2><p><b></b>On September 11th, 1977, a young boy was born in Champaign, Illinois. Although he was named Christopher Brian Bridges at birth, the world would later come to know him simply as "Ludacris." Bridges soon moved to Chicago, where he attended high school for a short time. He was the only son in his family, and the couple moved frequently across America. After a year of high school in Chicago, Christopher Bridges attended high school in Virginia. A year later, the family had moved once again – this time to Atlanta. In this city, Christopher Bridges laid down his roots and became involved in the music community.</p><h2 id=early-experiences-with-music><b>Early Experiences With Music</b></h2><p><b></b>After high school, Christopher Bridges attended Georgia State University, where he studied music management. Although this represented Bridges' first real taste of the music industry, the artist had been writing raps since the age of nine. He had also been involved with amateur rap groups from the age of fourteen. While he was in college, Ludacris started making connections with other rappers in the area, such as <a href=# title="Timbaland Net Worth">Timbaland</a>. Ludacris made his presence known after featuring on Timbaland's track "Phat Rabbit," and promptly began work on his debut album.</p><h2 id=debut-albums><b>Debut Albums</b></h2><p><b></b>Recording for Luda's debut album, <i>Incognegro</i>, began in 1998. During recording, the rapper's stage name became a point of focus. Explaining the origin of his name, the musician referenced his "split personality," which he considered to be insane or "ludicrous." Obviously, the last four letters of his stage name is a reference to his first name, Chris. Although the album wasn't very successful when it was released in 1999, it contained enough popular singles to put the rapper on the map.</p><p>The singles came to the attention of Def Jam Records, who signed Ludacris and helped him produce his first album for a major record label: <i>Back for the First Time</i>. This album was much more successful than the first, independently-released entry and reached the number four spot on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. Prominent names in the music industry featured on the album, including <a href=# title="Nate Dogg Net Worth">Nate Dogg</a>, Pharrell, and UGK.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295342 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/luda2.jpg alt width=823 height=544 sizes="(max-width: 823px) 100vw, 823px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295342 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=later-albums><b>Later Albums</b></h2><p><b></b>The rapper's next two albums were <i>Word of Mouf</i> and <i>Chicken-n-Beer</i>. The latter album was less popular than the first due to the lack of successful singles. With that said, Ludacris had become a household name by the end of 2003. Various singles from both albums were enough to push Ludacris' career forward. His music videos were especially useful tools that kept the rapper in the limelight, and he was nominated for a Grammy during this time. He also collaborated with major names such as <a href=# title="Snoop Dogg Net Worth">Snoop Dogg</a>, Chingy, and <a href=# title="Kanye West Net Worth">Kanye West</a>.</p><p>Ludacris' fourth album, <i>The Red Light District, </i>debuted at the number one spot on the Billboard charts and featured artists such as <a href=# title="DMX Net Worth">DMX</a>, T.I., and Nas. In 2006, Ludacris released his fifth album, <i>Release Therapy. </i>He continued his pattern of collaborating with other artists and producing hit singles – the most notable of which was "Money Maker," which became a number-one single. The album itself also reached the number one spot on the <i>Billboard</i> album charts after selling 309,000 units.</p><p>From 2008 to 2009, Ludacris released two more albums: <i>Theater of the Mind </i>and <i>Battle of the Sexes</i>. Although they contained many notable singles and collaborations with well-known artists, the albums did not perform as well as Luda's earlier entries. Ludacris made a strong comeback with the release of his next album, <i>Ludaversal</i>. The album received positive reviews and debuted at the number three spot on the <i>Billboard </i>200. In 2021, Ludacris released the soundtrack to the Netflix series, "Karma's World."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295343 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ludacris-1.jpg alt="Ludacris Net Worth" width=900 height=672 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295343 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alberto E.
