But it's definitely a terrifying horror film. Brought to us by the director of Hereditary, Ari Aster, <a href=# class=T3D>Midsommar</a><a href=# class=T3D> is a creepy folk horror story</a> about an American couple and their friends who go to Sweden for a summer solstice festival hosted by the Swedish Hårga commune. Although they assume it will be a happy-go-lucky, relaxed boho festival, it ends up being <a href=# class=T3D>full of rituals</a> and horrific moments... and that's all I can say without giving away too many spoilers. That said, there are some <a href=# class=T3D>great Midsommar Halloween costume ideas</a> if you're looking for something to wear during the holiday that's both creepy and striking.</p><p>In all actuality, Midsommar costumes are probably going to be a pretty option this year. Not only are they relatively easy to put together, but you'll probably be able to wear these pieces even when it isn't Halloween. Aside from those logical reasons, it's also just a good spooky costume idea for horror movie lovers who will really appreciate it... and it's on the more unique side.</p><p>If you're looking to creep out everyone who's seen the film and get a good costume going, here are a few ideas on exactly what to wear:</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Basic Flower Crown Outfit</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>The Midsommar costume that you can expect to see most people wearing is going to be one that is seen throughout most of the movie: a take on an embroidered floral dress based on traditional Swedish folk dresses and a flower crown. Here's one option for recreating that:</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Embroidered Dress With Head Scarf</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>Midsommar costume designer Andrea Flesch told Bustle in July 2019 that she <a href=#>looked for inspiration</a> in both old Swedish folk dresses and in Hungary, where they filmed. "Here you can find all of the fabrics," she told Bustle, "so I bought tons of 100-year-old linen fabric and embroidery, and I tried to find embroideries in Eastern Europe which looked like they could be also Swedish."</p><p>Dresses like the one below are a good enough imitation for Halloween. If you don't want to wear a flower crown, a bandana on your head is another option from the film.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Full Costume</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>If you want to opt for a similar look with accessories that reflect more of what went on in the film, there's a full costume from Etsy that covers pretty much everything — I won't get into it because of major spoilers!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Another Flower Dress</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>If you want to get a little more dramatic, opt for an embroidered floral dress as well as a huge flower crown. You can also always try making one yourself with fake flowers and garland from a craft store.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Dani's Outfit</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>Dani, the American woman visiting Sweden and one of the main characters of the film, mostly wore a blue and white embroidered dress with her own wildflower crown. Copy that the best you can with this look.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Big Flower Dress At The End</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>A24</p></figure><p>Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say that the end of Midsommar reveals a fantastically elaborate gown literally covered in flowers. It would be an epic costume, but one that requires a lot of work. Start with a maxi dress, then glue fake flowers all over it — and have an elaborate flower crown as well.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jm9kpqGUqLyuucCrZKGZnKG8uLHEp2Scp6Opwq6xjKKbnpmjYsGprdOlo2abmJa7qLGMoaawZamkwm7DxJqpZp6cpMSmvoycqaivnqh6coSWcW1xbGI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-taylor-fritz-s-ex-wife-and-the-mother-of-his-son.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Taylor Fritz's Ex-Wife and the Mother of His Son?</span></a>
