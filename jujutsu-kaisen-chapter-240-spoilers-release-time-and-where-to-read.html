So what better opportunity would he have to deliver it than during Takaba’s confrontation with Kenjaku? Granted, not everything about it is fun and games, but there are some great moments to be taken from chapter 240.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 240 spoilers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/king_jin__woo3/status/1717039235646308473</figure><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>According to the leaks of the chapter’s Japanese release, this one starts off with a flashback, set before the end of Sukuna’s fight with Gojo. The Sorcerers are considering a surprise attack on Kenjaku, as it would be too hard to deal with both him and Sukuna if Gojo loses. Even if Gojo manages to win, dealing with Kenjaku would be no easy task, Angel adds, before recommending sending Takaba to face off against him. When Hakari and Kusakabe doubt her, Angel prepares to share Takaba’s cursed technique, but before she does so, we jump back to the present.</p><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Kenjaku attacks Takaba with Geto’s centipede curses, but it doesn’t work. Instead, the sorcerer makes Kenjaku wear a bandana with the American flag and taunts him by saying that he can’t win against him. Because of this, the antagonist thinks that Takaba’s technique may be to materialize his imagination, but affirms that everyone’s abilities have a weakness. After a bit of back and forth between the two, Takaba questions why Kenjaku does what he does, to which he replies that he does it because it’s fun.</p><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>The sorcerer says that Kenjaku’s face is basically asking him to make him laugh, so he tries to do that by making a joke. Although the antagonist understands the joke, he starts pulling it apart logically and criticizing Takaba’s comedic abilities, which clearly unsettles him. Then, Kenjaku lands a hit on his opponent, coming to the realization that his technique actually relies on his confidence, which continues to waver as he gets more and more upset. Takaba starts to think that Kenjaku is funnier than him, and after he sees Hazenoki’s corpse, he loses all confidence in himself and his comedic skills.</p><h2 id=h-when-and-where-to-read-jujutsu-kaisen-chapter-240-in-english data-injectable=false>When and where to read Jujutsu Kaisen chapter 240 in English</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://twitter.com/king_jin__woo3/status/1717049151513563465</figure><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Chapter 240 of Jujutsu Kaisen will be officially released in English and several other languages on Oct. 29, at 10am CT.
