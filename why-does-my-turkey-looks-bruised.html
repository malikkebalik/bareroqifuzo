To further prevent bruising from occurring, keep produce that you are not ready to eat in the refrigerator. You may also notice fruits turning brown once they have been cut to serve. In this way, how can you tell if Turkey is spoiled? The best way is to smell and look at the turkey: signs of bad turkey are a sour smell and a slimy texture to the cooked turkey; discard any turkey with an off smell or appearance, do not taste the turkey first.How long does a turkey last in the fridge?
