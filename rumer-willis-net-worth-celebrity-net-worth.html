In 2019 she appeared in 7 episodes of "The Masked Singer".</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Rumer Willis was born on August 16, 1988 in Padacah, Kentucky. At the time of her birth, Willis' parents, <a href=# title="Bruce Willis Net Worth">Bruce Willis</a> and Demi Moore, were in Kentucky while Bruce was shooting the film "In Country." Rumer also has two younger sisters, Scout and Tallulah. She grew up primarily in Hailey, Idaho, as her parents desired to give their daughters a "normal" upbringing despite their super stardom.</p><p>When Willis was only 6, she had her first acting role in the film "Now and Then" when she played the on-film daughter of her mother, who was starring in the 1995 film. While it was a small role, Willis developed her love of acting from this experience and decided to follow in the footsteps of her parents.</p><p>At the age of 10, Willis's parents decided to divorce. Willis was able to avoid much of the publicity surrounding the divorce, as her parents made an effort to shield the children from it, in addition to committing themselves to an amicable split. Despite the separation, the family continued celebrating holidays and birthdays together and even went on vacations as a family.</p><p>Willis spent her freshman year of high school at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Michigan before transferring to Wildwood Secondary School in Los Angeles, California as a freshman. After graduating high school, she briefly attended the University of Southern California.</p><h2 id=acting-career><strong>Acting Career</strong></h2><p>Since her first role at the age of 6 in "Now and Then," Willis continued acting throughout her childhood. She appeared in the film "Striptease" in 1996 and then worked alongside her father in "The Whole Nine Yards" in 2000. She again worked with her father in the 2005 film "Hostage" and then started landing more prominent roles, playing the role of Joanne in the 2008 film, "The House Bunny" and winning the "Breakthrough Performance Female" award at the Young Hollywood Awards for her performance in the 2009 film, "Wild Cherry." The same year, she also appeared in the horror movie, "Sorority Role." She earned a nomination for that role in the Teen Choice Awards in the category of "Choice Movie Actress: Horror/Thriller." She scored her first lead role in the 2013 dram, "The Odd Way Home."</p><p>Willis also worked in television, appearing in a wide number of series including "Miss Guided, "CSI: NY," "Medium," "Workaholics," and "The Secret Life of the American Teenager," among others. She had a recurring role in "90210," appearing in ten episodes during the 2009-2010 season.

She has since tried to become a healthy role model for young girls and women, promoting self-love and acceptance on her social media accounts.</p><p>Several years after her parents' divorced, Willis's mother began dating actor Ashton Kutcher. This proved difficult for Willis, whose relationship with her mother began to sour and the two briefly stopped speaking with one another. Scout and Tallulah, Willis's younger sisters, also stopped talking to Moore but Willis was the first to begin a relationship with her mother again, acting as a sort of family ambassador between her sisters and their mother until everyone was on speaking terms again after a few years. Now Willis maintains a close relationship with her mother, who has since released on autobiography detailing that time in her life.</p><p>Willis maintains a private life but has been romantically connected to several partners over the years. She dated actor Micah Alberti for over two years until the couple split in 2010. Her next serious relationship was with actor Jayson Blair in 2013.
