A movie based on his book was produced, starring <a href=#>Tony Curtis</a> as Demara. The TV series The Pretender (1996) was partially inspired by his life.</p><p>Biography in: "The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives". Volume One, 1981-1985, pages 219-221. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1998.</p><p>Ferdinand Waldo Demara, more popularly known as Fred W. Demara was a colorful and very intelligent person who assumed the identities of others in order to shortcut through life and place himself in various positions or careers. Amongst others, over time, he was a Canadian Navy Surgeon, civil engineer designing a bridge, a sheriff's deputy, an assistant prison warden, a doctor of applied psychology, a hospital orderly, a lawyer, a child-care expert, a Benedictine monk, a Trappist monk, an editor, a cancer researcher, and a teacher - and at the end of his life a hospital chaplain in his own name. Articles appeared about him in Time Magazine and Life magazine and other newspapers and publications. <a href=#>Robert Crichton</a> wrote two books about him, one of which "The Great Imposter" 1959 was developed into a movie with Demara played by <a href=#>Tony Curtis</a> - although the story became fictionally embellished around Curtis. This notoriety got Demara one acting role in the movie "The Hypnotic Eye". While he was a convincing actor in real life he did poorly on film. In one of his "careers" he actually made news as a successful navy surgeon saving 13 soldiers, the publicity of which became his undoing by exposing his impersonation.</p><p>In another career in 1951 he founded LaMennais College in Alfred Maine which continued to exist 8 years past his departure until 1959 when it became the current Walsh University in Canton Ohio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfm7%2BmsIydnKaZopY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dramatic-married-at-first-sight-trailer-hints-lauren-cheated-on-orion.html><span>←</span><span>Dramatic 'Married at First Sight' Trailer Hints Lauren Cheated on Orion</span></a>
