I keep putting money aside because I know that if I want to splurge, there is a big mountain of money that I can use."</p><p>"I think it was very important for me to look at starting to build a safety net so that I didn't feel the insecurity of the ups and downs of finances because I might do no film a year or I might do six commercials or I might do none."</p><p>"Risks are important. But a big risk without a safety net is something I wouldn't do. You have to have a safety net so that even if you fall, you don't get killed."</p><p>"Financial independence is paramount. My mom always says that when a woman is financially independent, she has the ability to live life on her own terms. I think that was the soundest advice that I ever got. No matter where you go in life or who you get married to, you have to be financially independent—whether you use it or not. You don't know what curve balls life will throw at you. You should have the ability to take care of yourself and the people you love. That has always stayed in my mind."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZL2ztdiapaSZXZi1sLzRmmSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-maines-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Maines Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
