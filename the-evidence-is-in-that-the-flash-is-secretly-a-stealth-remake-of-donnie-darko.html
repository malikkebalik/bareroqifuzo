Jake Gyllenhaal’s breakthrough movie sees him play the titular character, whose life is thrown into turmoil when, after sleepwalking from his bed, he meets Frank, a mysterious figure in a rabbit costume who tells him the world will end in precisely 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=137 data-injectable=false>Upon waking Donnie discovers a falling jet engine has landed on his bed, setting off a chain of bizarre events with a bittersweet finale.</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>So what does any of that have to do with The Flash?

(I think they say he’s studying economics?) One day, he’s confronted by a magical time-travelling entity, who forces superpowers upon him and warns that the world will end in, like, a few weeks. The entity drags him along on a surreal esoteric dream-journey where he meets interesting people, and ultimately falls in love with Supergirl. Forced to watch her die over and over again, as the world collapses, Young Barry ultimately decides that his existence is a mistake, and sacrifices himself to erase the doomed timeline.</p><p>In other words, it’s Donnie Darko as told from the perspective of Frank the Rabbit – albeit a comedy version it’s also not-too-gradually revealed that Frank’s an idiot with no real clue what he’s doing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-e1676152973147.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-ezra-miller-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sasha-Calle-Supergirl-The-Flash.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Sasha-Calle-The-Flash.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-zod.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-flash-batman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Michael-Keaton-Batman-The-Flash-1.jpg><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Sure, why not?
