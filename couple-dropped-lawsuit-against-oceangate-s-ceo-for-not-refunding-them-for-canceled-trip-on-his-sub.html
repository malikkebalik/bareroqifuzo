In light of these tragic events, we have informed our attorneys to withdraw all legal actions against Stockton," they said.</p><p>"Like most around the world, we have watched the coverage of the OceanGate Titan capsule with great concern and enormous amount of sadness and compassion for the families of those who lost their lives," they added. "We honor their zest for life, as well as their commitment to the exploration of our oceans."</p><p>The couple also said that "honor, respect and dignity" are more important to humanity than money, and sent their wishes to the families of those who died.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hagles filed their lawsuit in February 2023, Fox 35 Orlando reported.</p><p>The couple, who have previously <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>gone into space</a> with Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, first entered into a contract with OceanGate in 2016, to go on a 2018 trip aboard the company's Cyclops 2 vessel, which later changed its name to Titan, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>the outlet reported</a>, citing court filings.</p><p>They paid a $20,000 deposit, the documents said.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Sharon and Marc Hagle flew with Blue Origin in March. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Blue Origin</span></span></figure><p>The Hagles then wired $190,258 to OceanGate in February 2018, according to court filings. Contracts around this time also showed the vessel's name change to Titan, the outlet said.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed that OceanGate then canceled the expedition planned for June 2018, rescheduling it for July 2019, but that later trip was also canceled because a support vessel couldn't take part, according to Fox 35 Orlando.</p><p>The couple asked for a full refund in June 2019, and the company said it was working on it, according to the filings.</p><p>But the lawsuit said OceanGate then told the couple a few months later that they would be part of a July 2021 trip and wouldn't get their refund if they declined, according to the report.</p><p>Rush also told them their money would be held in an escrow account but that also didn't happen, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>OceanGates' Titan submersible lost contact with its mothership an hour and 45 minutes into its dive on June 18, 2023, sparking a desperate search to find the vessel.</p><p>The US Coast Guard said on Thursday that debris found in the search indicated the vessel had imploded, and that the five people on board had died.</p><p>Over the past week it has become clear that experts repeatedly <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>raised</a> safety concerns regarding the vessel, and old clips of Rush dismissing safety regulations in the name of innovation have also <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>emerged</a>.</p><p>There have also been other reports of failed trips. CBS News' David Pogue went on the submersible in 2021 but said the trip was <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>canceled</a> after 37 feet due to an equipment malfunction.</p><p>In addition to Rush, four other passengers died aboard the Titan: British billionaire <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Hamish Harding,</a> former French navy diver <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Paul-Henri Nargeolet,</a> and British-Pakistani businessman <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman.</a></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
