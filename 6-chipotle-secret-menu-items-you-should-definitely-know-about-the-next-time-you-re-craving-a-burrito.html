I mean, imagine a world brimming with, say, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Chipotle secret menu items</a> you never even thought to order — that's something you'd want to know about, right?! As it turns out, your favorite Mexican establishment does indeed serve up unique meals you won't find on its standard menu — and I'm here to tell you all about a few must-try secret menu items you've been missing out on all along.</p><p>Yes, even the crowning jewel of the burrito kingdom has a role in the secret menu madness. The regular <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Chipotle menu</a> is simple and straightforward enough, so there's no reason to suspect a hidden agenda. You decide whether you want a burrito, bowl, taco, or salad. You pick your meat, add toppings, and boom! What more could there be, right? Wrong. Long-time customers have probably picked up on a few tricks here and there (like asking for extra toppings, or getting your tortilla on the side), but there are a few special orders even die-hard fans and dedicated college students probably don't know. Here are six ways to order off of the Chipotle secret menu for optimal deliciousness.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Quesadilla</a></h3><p>Honestly, I find it kind of surprising that quesadillas aren't already regular menu items at Chipotle. Whether you realized this was a secret menu item or not, you're welcome.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Quesarito</a></h3><p>You may have heard of this quesadilla-wrapped-burrito concoction from Taco Bell, but rest assured, Chipotle does it too — it just isn't advertised. That's right, a secret menu item is used to make another secret menu item. It's secret menu inception.</p><h3>3. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Burritodilla</a></h3><p>Ah, yet another quesadilla hybrid. Can't choose between a hot-pressed quesadilla or a classic burrito? Get this option that combines both! Crunchy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside, this just proves that good things do come in small, aluminum foil packages.</p><h3>4. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Nachos</a></h3><p>This secret menu item may not be the wackiest combination you've ever heard of, but Chipotle will let you get a bed of chips in place of rice if you ask nicely. And just like that, your burrito bowl has magically transformed into a majestic platter of nachos.</p><h3>5. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Double-Wrapped Burrito</a></h3><p>Whereas the Quesarito reminds me of the popular Taco Bell item, this special order is reminiscent of TB's popular Crunchwrap Supreme. And the best part? For the perfect balance of crunchy and soft, the extra shell is free of charge.</p><h3>6. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Extras, Including Fillings And Cilantro</a></h3><p>At Chipotle, you can always squeeze in a few extra toppings to your order if you simply ask — except for guacamole, of course. With meat-based orders, you can get the grilled fajita veggies. With burrito bowls, you can ask for a tortilla or soft tacos on the side, as well as the tangy Chipotle salad dressing (all of which don't usually come with it). Get more than one salsa, ask for extra cheese, go crazy. And although you won't see it on the serving table, ask for fresh cilantro, and it's all yours.</p><p>Image: <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Laine Trees</a>/Flickr</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx6hZJqa2ZuXZi1qrzOraOeZaOasLOx02aknqalYra1scysZLKnpWLAqbvUpZtmnJWbtq%2B1056jsmWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXam1pnnNnq%2BtZaSeuqZ52Kisq51dmL%2BiwsinnmaZ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wyndham-clark-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Wyndham Clark Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
