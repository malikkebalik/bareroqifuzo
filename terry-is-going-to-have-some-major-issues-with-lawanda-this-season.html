But there are some other things that really tap into the heart of the family dynamic and how, just like anybody else’s family, we get challenged. It’s bringing a lot of drama, a lot of sizzle. A lot of secrets will be revealed in the coming episodes.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Terry is going to have some major issues with LaWanda in season 2</h2><p id=par-5_52>At <a href=#>the beginning of season 2</a>, when Terry vowed to stay out of the drug game, he and LaWanada rekindled their relationship. As the mother of his child, Terry loves LaWanda, but it’s obvious he’s no longer in love with her. Since LaWanda isn’t stupid, this will undoubtedly cause major issues.</p><p id=par-6_86>“My character is loyal. My character is determined,” Mitchell told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibe</a>. “And my character is very laid back. But not this season. Not this season. I take that back. She’s a little feisty this season. I think they [fans] are going to be most excited to see how Lawanda this season is not really taking no mess. Last season she was kind of laying down, being the baby mama. This time she’s kind of stepping out like, ‘Okay, I’m not going for it anymore.’ She’s elevated.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-terry-s-relationship-with-markisha-will-cause-chaos-in-bmf-season-2>Terry’s relationship with Markisha will cause chaos in ‘BMF’ Season 2</h2><p id=par-7_41>Not only will Terry be dealing with some pushback from Lawanda, but he will also be confronting some major issues that stem from <a href=#>his burgeoning relationship with Markisha.</a> Fans of BMF know that Terry has pursued Markisha even though she’s married.</p><p id=par-8_89>“I think a lot of times if people … if they live in their own world, it’s like this perfect relationship,” Anthony told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Express U.K.</a>&nbsp;“As their relationship progresses, they get to see how it’s not this perfect little world that they’re living in. He has a family; she has her husband, and she has kids as well – like there’s so many other factors that go into it. It can’t just be two people saying, ‘we just want to ride off into the sunset together’ life doesn’t work like that.”</p><p id=par-9_54>When Meech learns about Terry and Markisha, he won’t be pleased. “Meech has this thing with Markisha. Meech does not like Markisha at all,” Da’Vinchi told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">POPSUGAR</a>. “And I think that starts making the brothers build a certain tension again, which some could argue and say that that could be part of the brothers’ demise.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvrrKMrZyrqqliuqK2zqtkoqujqrK0edaiq6FlnJbEorrDmmStoJmoerSxwKymp2aYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paul-schneider-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Paul Schneider Net Worth</span></a>
