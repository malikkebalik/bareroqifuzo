The strange charisma of Bateman, coupled with his riches, allows him to get away with murder. Crucially though, the book and movie don’t ever make any clear explanations for what is going on.</p><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>That is the very problem Ellis feels is coming out of modern horror movies: far too much explanation of what is happening, and an overreliance on explaining everything. Speaking to Variety, Ellis suggests modern horror should harken back to the 70s for how to handle a mystery, or rather not even mention a mystery.</p><p>“Especially in the ‘70s, horror movies did not have backstories or answers to them explaining the horror. Why is Regan possessed by a devil in The Exorcist? We don’t know. Why does the shark cruise Amity in Jaws? You don’t know. Where did Carrie White get her powers? I don’t know. You could go on and on with the mystery of these movies, and what made them so much more frightening was that they weren’t explained. I often find now when a horror movie goes way too far into backstory, in terms of explaining why these people do what they do, or why this monster does what it does, it really minimizes the horror.”</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>To paraphrase from his character Patrick Bateman, the Texas Chain Saw Massacre is where Ellis feels the genre really came into its own, both commercially and artistically. He feels the whole movie has a clear, crisp feel.</p><p>“I think The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a great example. We just do not know what that family is. We get hints of what’s happened to them, but we do not get an explanation at all as to what created Leatherface.”</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=317 data-injectable=false>American Psycho has seen a resurgence over the last two years thanks to meme culture, with “sigma male” memes heavily featuring Bale’s portrayal of Bateman as a sort of unintentional idol. The famous Huey Lewis and the News monologue remains a cult classic, with it feeling like a scene out of time.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=false>2022 has been a surprisingly strong year for the horror genre, with major releases and smaller indie features making their way into the mainstream. Among the favorites of the American Psycho scribe has been Barbarian, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">which saw praise from fellow author Stephen King.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurrHRopqapl2lwLqvx6hkmq2knbyzec2apJ6rXZ22tHnSoqWgpJVir6qzxp6qrWWZqMC2sYywoK2gXaK8pbHRp2Shp6KnvLN7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paxton-whitehead-friends-actor-and-stage-veteran-dead-at-85.html><span>←</span><span>Paxton Whitehead, Friends actor and stage veteran, dead at 85</span></a>
