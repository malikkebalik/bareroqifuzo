She is best known for appearing on the hit Bravo series Millionaire Matchmaker and for being a contestant on Survivor: Tocantins.</p><p>Smith was born in 1977 in Dayton, Ohio and attended the University of Dayton on a full academic scholarship. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a minor in Communications. Smith&nbsp;went on to attend&nbsp;law school at Northwestern University School of Law in Chicago, and passed the Ohio Bar exam in 2002. Shortly thereafter, she began practicing commercial real estate law at one of the largest law firms in Ohio; during this time she also won the title of Miss Ohio USA.&nbsp;She soon moved to Los Angeles where she became one of "Barker's Beauties" on The Price Is Right game show and continued a career in acting with&nbsp;roles on Fox's Method & Red, HBO's Entourage. and the NBC's sitcom,&nbsp;Joey.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162652 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Candace-Smith1.jpg alt="Candace Smith" width=453 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-162652 class=wp-caption-text>Angela Weiss/Getty Images</p><p>She has appeared in several films alongside actors like <a href=# title="Jake Gyllenhaal Net Worth">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>, <a href=# title="Michael Pena Net Worth">Michael Pena</a>, <a href=# title="Rosario Dawson Net Worth">Rosario Dawson</a>, and <a href=# title="Vanessa Hudgens Net Worth">Vanessa Hudgens</a>. In 2014, Smith joined Bravo's 8th season of The Millionaire Matchmaker as the Director of Recruiting for&nbsp;<a href=# title="Patti Stanger Net Worth">Patti Stanger</a>'s successful matchmaking service. This was not her first appearance on the show, as she also appeared on an episode in 2007. The premiere episode of the 8th season of Millionaire Matchmaker, which was Smith's first appearance in her new role, &nbsp;was the most watched in the history of the series with 1.5 million viewers; this is likely because of the show's&nbsp;new format and an&nbsp;all-celebrity client list. In addition to her work in television, Smith also continues to model in several national commercial and print campaigns.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97wa6qoqaVqMBusdeemq6smauytHvCmqWdmZOaerS5yK2fZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./allis-chalmers-c-serial-number-price-specs-history-2022.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Allis Chalmers C Serial Number, Price, Specs, History 2022</span></a>
