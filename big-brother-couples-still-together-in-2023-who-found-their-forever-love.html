It’s common knowledge that couples who met on reality TV rarely stay together for very long. Constant close quarters bring out the rawest and most intense emotions in the contestants. Most of the couples who developed during the show are no longer together because romance tends to burn out once people return to the real world."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Like previous seasons, this one featured intense competition, emotional highs and lows, and plenty of drama.</p><p>It’s common knowledge that couples who met on reality TV rarely stay together for very long. Constant close quarters bring out the rawest and most intense emotions in the contestants. Most of the couples who developed during the show are no longer together because romance tends to burn out once people return to the real world. Love, though, can sometimes last forever.</p><p>Only ten of the many relationships that began in the Big Brother house (or “showmances,” as the public dubs them) are still going strong as of this writing. These couples should be recognized for the hard work and commitment it took to reach this point in their relationships. All the lasting relationships from Big Brother are documented here. Check out who Big Brother couples are still together in the below section.</p><h2>Which Big Brother Couples Are Still Together in 2023?</h2><p><strong>Read out which couples are still together:</strong></p><h3>Claire Rehfuss & Derek Xiao</h3><p>The current status is dating! Although they were secretly attracted to one another throughout their time in the house, their relationship blossomed once they were placed on the jury. When the competition concluded, I didn’t want to leave Claire,” Derek told, “and I was writing in my journal one night in the jury.”</p><p>My feelings for Claire went beyond that of a friend at this point. And because I didn’t believe Claire shared my feelings, I was too timid to express them to her. I was relieved that she was the one to initiate the conversation.</p><h3>Christmas Abbot & Memphis Garrett</h3><p>The Current Scoop: They’re Hitched! They chose to take their friendship to the next level after meeting during the 2020 summer season of Big Brother: All-Stars.</p><p>According to what Christmas revealed, “It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when I felt my feelings for Memphis grow from just a friendship to more because I believe that our friendship IS what’s more.” The Little Palm Island Resort and Spa in Florida is where Memphis pops the question in June of 2021. Later, on Memorial Day weekend in 2022, the couple tied the knot.</p><p><strong>You can also find out which couples from other tv shows are still together:</strong></p><h3>Bayleigh Amethyst & Swaggy C</h3><p>Current Scenario: Even though they only worked together for a total of 23 days, their early-game chemistry and affection were evident. In reality, on the night of the finale, Swaggy C proposed to Bayleigh.</p><p>The future bride told Ross Mathews and Marissa Winokur, “As soon as he went down on his knee, I was like, ‘Yes, yes, yes!'” Although the couple has tied the knot, they have not yet celebrated their nuptials with friends and family.</p><p>In the end, they form an unbreakable friendship. “Babe, I know that you will ride for me without a shadow of a doubt, just as I will ride for you because you have been!” Before, Bayleigh shared her thoughts on Instagram. To be meaningful, relationships must be resilient in the face of adversity. Having weathered every storm together, I can confidently say that our love was made to last. Let’s push on to greater heights and brighter futures.</p><h3>Winston Hines and Rachel Swindler</h3><p>The current situation is that despite the hopes of their admirers and some adorable Instagram posts, they are merely pals. I have the highest regard for Rachel, but I think she is saving her true affection for the house. Doubtful that JC is aware of this… Back in the fall of 2018, Winston joked around.</p><p>Rachel continued, Right now, we’re not anything official but you never know what could happen in the future. Winston is a really attractive and desirable man in my opinion. Any woman would be lucky to have him because of his kind and generous nature. He and Brett are romantically involved. That’s a link that’s difficult to sever. LOL!</p><p>If you want to know details about other couples details then you can join us on our <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter account</a>.
