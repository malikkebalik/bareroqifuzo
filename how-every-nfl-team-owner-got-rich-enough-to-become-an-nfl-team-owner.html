Football, both college and NFL, are in full swing. Saturdays and Sundays (and Thursdays and Mondays) are packed with gridiron goodness. And if you're like me, you might occasionally find yourself daydreaming about someday owning your very own NFL franchise. After all, they are pretty valuable properties (as you can tell from this article: <a href=#>The Most Valuable NFL Teams</a>)… But how exactly does someone go about earning enough money to buy an NFL team??? You're about to&nbsp;find out!</p><p>Buying an NFL team is a crazy expensive endeavor. For the money it takes to buy, own, and run an NFL franchise, you could own several mega yachts, a fleet of private jets and a private island in the Bahamas. But these people below decided to buy an NFL franchise with that money. You know what? I would too.</p><p>Let's face it, sometimes football fans think NFL owners have more money than brains. How else do you explain Norv Turner and AJ Smith lasting so long in San Diego? The Spanos family (which owns The Chargers) has to have taken a leave of their sanity. Or how about the Robert Irsay's Baltimore Colts packing everything up in the middle of the night and decamping for Indianapolis? Or, well, anything <a href=# title="Al Davis Net Worth">Al Davis</a> did except firing Lane Kiffin mid-season in 2008. Turns out that old Al may have been crazy, but he knew what he was doing in this instance. (Disclaimer: I am a USC Alumna and huge USC football fan. Lane Kiffin is Satan.) Do I even need to mention Georgia Frontiere's reign as owner of the St. Louis Rams? But enough beating around the bush, let's look at how each NFL team owner got rich enough to purchase a professional football franchise:</p><p><strong>Arizona Cardinals</strong></p><p>Owner: Bill Bidwill – Owner Since: 1972</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1 billion</p><p>Bidwell's Story: Bill Bidwill inherited the St. Louis Cardinals from his father Charles, who was a Chicago lawyer who allegedly had connections to mobster Al Capone. Bill moved the team from St. Louis to Arizona in 1988 after demands for a new stadium were not met.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Falcons</strong></p><p>Owner: <a href=#>Arthur Blank</a> – Owner Since: 2002</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.1 billion, making them the 26th most valuable NFL team. Current owner Arthur Blank reportedly paid $545 for the team</p><p>Blank's Story: Blank co-founded Home Depot in 1978. 'Nuff said, right? Blank is worth $3.9 billion – a far cry from the early days of the very early days of Home Depot, Blank and his partner would stand in the parking lot handing out $1 bills to try and get customers to go in and take a look around their store.</p><p><strong>Baltimore Ravens</strong></p><p>Owner: <a href=#>Stephen Bisciotti</a> – Owner Since: 2004</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.5 billion- the 2012 Super Bowl win helped. Bisciotti was a minority owner of the team since 2000 until he became the full owner in 2004 in a $325 million deal with Art Model. The total amount he paid was $600 million. Bisciotti's Story: At 53, Bisciotti is the second youngest sole owner of an NFL team. <a href=# title="Dan Snyder Net Worth">Dan Snyder</a> of the Redskins is the youngest. Bisciotti founded Aerotek in a basement with his cousin. This later became the parent company the Allegis Group, which owns Aerotek and TEKsystems, engineering and technology staffing firms. He is a recruiter, basically. He is worth $1.6 billion.</p><p><strong>Buffalo Bills</strong></p><p>Owner: Terrence Pegula – Owner Since 2014</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.4 billion – After graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a BS in Engineering, went to work for the Getty Oil company. In 1983, at the age of 32, Terrence branched out on his own by founding an oil and gas exploration company he named East Resources. Over the next several decades, Easy Resources grew into an incredibly successful company. In 2010, Terrence sold off most of the company's assets to Royal Dutch Shell for $4.7 billion. He sold another chunk of assets to American Energy in 2014 for $1.75 billion. He then used a portion of his funds to purchase the Buffalo Sabres NHL team and the Buffalo Bandits lacrosse team for $189 million. He also gave an $88 million donation to Penn State to aid in the construction of their new Pegula Ice Arena, and gave another $12 million to Houghton University for their Kerr-Pegula Sports Complex. On September 9, 2014, it was announced that a group of investors led by Terry had won the right to purchase the Buffalo Bills NFL franchise for $1.4 billion from the estate of former owner Ralph Wilson. Terry's group beat out competing bids from a group led by <a href=# title="Jon Bon Jovi Net Worth">Jon Bon Jovi</a> and another group led by <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>.</p><p>Ralph Wilson – Buffalo Bills owner from 1959 -2014.&nbsp;(We had already written this and didn't want to just delete because Ralph was an awesome guy) Ralph Wilson founded the Buffalo bills as part of the American Football League in 1959. In 1970, the league merged with the NFL. Wilson was 94-years old at the time of his death in March 2014. That made him the oldest owner in the NFL. Just after WWII, Ralph took over his dad's insurance company. He had bigger dreams and a lot of business sense. Ralph acquired trucking companies, highway construction firms, manufacturing plants, and TV and radio stations in Detroit as well as around the country under the holding company Ralph Wilson Enterprises, making it no surprise that the Bills play in Ralph Wilson Stadium. In October 2014, it was announced that Ralph's estate would use a large portion of the $1.4 billion earned from selling the Bills to create a massive charity that will benefit the cities of Detroit and Buffalo.</p><p><strong>Carolina Panthers</strong></p><p>Owner: Jerry Richardson – Owner Since: 1993</p><p>Team Net Worth: Just over $1.2 billion</p><p>Richardson's Story: Richardson is a former NFL player for the Baltimore Colts. He was their wide receiver in 1959 and 1960, but he made his money owning Hardee's franchises in South Carolina and going on to run a food services company, Flagstar, as its CEO. Flagstar ran every single Denny's in the U.S. Richardson retired in 1995. He is personally worth $500 million.</p><p><strong>Chicago Bears</strong></p><p>Owner: Virginia Halas McCaskey – Owner Since: 1983</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.7 billion. McCaskey owns 80% of the Bears alongside her children and grandchildren.</p><p>Halas McCaskey's Story: The NFL. Seriously. Virginia Halas McCaskey is the eldest child of legendary Bears coach and owner George "Papa Bear" Halas who left the team to his daughter upon his death in 1983. George Halas took a A.E. Staley Company's (a starch manufacturer where he worked) rec league football team and basically turned it into the NFL. She is personally worth $1.6 billion.</p><p><strong>Cincinnati Bengals</strong></p><p>Owner: Mike Brown – Owner Since: 1991</p><p>Team Net Worth: $990 million. Brown took over the Bengals after his father died. He is also the General Manager of the Bengals. He and Jerry Jones are the only two owner/managers in the NFL. Brown's Story: Football. Like the Halas family, the Browns go way back in the NFL. Mike Brown's father Paul co-founded the Bengals.</p><p><strong>Cleveland Browns</strong></p><p>Owner: Jimmy Haslam – Owner Since: 2012</p><p>Team Net Worth: Haslam bought the Browns from Randy Lerner in 2012 for $1 billion</p><p>Haslam's Story: Haslam had to sell his minority interest in the Pittsburgh Steelers to buy the Browns per NFL rules not allowing owners to have ownership stakes in more than one team. Haslam is the CEO of the Pilot Flying J truck stop company. Haslam and his company are currently under federal investigation for allegedly cheating customers out of fuel rebates.</p><p><strong>Dallas Cowboys</strong></p><p>Owner: <a href=#>Jerry Jones</a> – Owner Since: 1989</p><p>Team Net Worth: $3.2 billion. The Cowboys are the Most Valuable NFL franchise.</p><p>Jones' Story: Jones bought the Cowboys for $140 million in 1989. He is one of the most visible (and eccentric) owners in pro sports. In 2009, Cowboys Stadium (now called AT&T Stadium in another multi-billion dollar deal) opened at a cost of $1.3 billion to build. Jones made his money in oil in the 1970s and '80s. Jones' net worth is $2.7 billion.</p><p><strong>Denver Broncos</strong></p><p>Owner: <a href=# title="Pat Bowlen Net Worth">Pat Bowlen</a> – Owner Since: 1984</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.45 billion.</p><p>Bowlen's Story: Bowlen was an attorney in Edmonton before he became an executive in, you guessed it, his family's oil drilling and exploration company, Regent Resources. Bowlen's personal net worth is $1 billion.</p><p><strong>Detroit Lions</strong></p><p>Owner: Martha Firestone Ford&nbsp;– Owner Since: 1963 (through her husband)</p><p>Team Net Worth: Martha's husband William Clay Ford bought the Lions for $4.5 million in 1963. The team is worth $960 million today. That's $4.5 million per playoff wins for this beleaguered team from the Motor City. Ford was Henry Ford's (last surviving) grandson. He was&nbsp;the largest stockholder in the Ford Motor Company and was worth $$1.2 billion at the time of his death.&nbsp;Martha is the granddaughter of Firestone and Rubber Company founder Harvey Firestone.</p><p><strong>Green Bay Packers</strong></p><p>Owner: Green Bay Packers, Inc. – Owner Since: n/a</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.4 billion</p><p>The Packers' Story: The Packers are a publicly traded non-profit company owned by their shareholders. There are currently 364,122 shareholders of the Packers. When the organization needs money for something expensive like a stadium renovation, they sell more shares to raise funding. There can never be a majority owner of the Green Bay Packers as there is a limit on how many shares any one person can hold in the team. This business model has been banned by the NFL despite its success and effectiveness. Green Bay was grandfathered in.</p><p><strong>Houston Texans</strong></p><p>Owner: Robert C. McNair – Owner Since: 2002</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.9 billion currently. McNair and his partners bought this expansion team for $700 million. The Texans are the 5th most valuable NFL team.

He bought the Los Angeles Rams for $19 million in 1972. He then traded teams with Carroll Rosenbloom, ending up with the Baltimore Colts. That bit of hijinks should have clued Colts fans into Irsay's shenanigans, maybe they wouldn't have been so shocked when he packed the team up and moved them in the middle o the night from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984. Irsay is personally worth $1.2 billion.</p><p><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></p><p>Owner: <a href=#>Shahid Khan</a> – Owner Since: 2012</p><p>Team Net Worth: $965 million. Shocking, right? Do they actually win games? I kid, I kid!</p><p>Khan's Story: Khan was born in Pakistan and moved to the U.S. when he was 16-years old to study engineering at the University of Illinois. Post-college he went to work for Flex-N-Gate, an autoparts company making bumpers, as an engineering manager. Khan saw how inefficiently the manufacturing process was, streamlined it and started his own company – Bumper Works. Soon after he bought Flex-N-Gate which, since the 1980s has been the sole bumper supplier for Toyota. Khan's company made $3.9 billion in 2012.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-205364 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/khan.jpg alt="Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images" width=900 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-205364 class=wp-caption-text>Al Messerschmidt/Getty Images</p><p><strong>Kansas City Chiefs</strong></p><p>Owner: Clark Hunt – Owner Since: 2006</p><p>Team Net Worth: $1.1 billion.
