<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Jason Oppenheim Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2 id=what-jason-oppenheim8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Jason Oppenheim's net worth?</strong></h2><p>Jason Oppenheim is an American real estate broker, attorney, and reality television personality who has a net worth of $50 million. Jason Oppenheim is best known for being featured on the Netflix reality series "Selling Sunset" (2019–present) alongside his twin brother, Brett. During his career to date, Jason has closed more than $1 billion in sales and at any given time has over $100 million in active listings. He is the President and Founder of the Los Angeles-based real estate brokerage The Oppenheim Group, and he was named one of the Best Real Estate Agents in America by the "Wall Street Journal" in 2019 as well as the #1 Agent in the Hollywood Hills/Sunset Strip area. Oppenheim previously worked as an attorney at O'Melveny & Myers.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jason Oppenheim was born on April 12, 1977, in Palo Alto, California. His great-great-grandfather, Jacob Stern, founded The Stern Realty Co. after moving to Los Angeles in 1889. The company later became known as The Oppenheim Group, which "represents five generations of real estate development, management and brokerage services in Los Angeles." Jason comes from a Jewish family, and he is the son of Deborah and&nbsp; Bennett Oppenheim. After his parents divorced, Deborah raised Jason and his twin brother, Brett, as a single mother.</p><p>In a 2020 interview with the "Daily Mail," Oppenheim said of his youth, "'I was a frustrated, aggressive, trouble making kid, raised by a single mom. Brett and I were incorrigible; very difficult to raise as we were intelligent, but argumentative and had huge antipathy towards authority. We went to seven different high schools and boarding schools, and were either expelled or suspended from five of them." The twins were arrested several times for "fighting or doing some stupid things," and Deborah sent them to a teen correctional camp in Idaho when they were 13 years old. Jason and Brett eventually moved in with their father, a Vietnam vet who was a strict disciplinarian, and turned their lives around. Oppenheim earned both his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of California, Berkeley, and he was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa fraternity. According to Jason's bio on The Oppenheim Group website, he graduated first in his class at UC Berkeley and taught in the school's Legal Studies and Political Science departments.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-300811 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jo.jpg alt="Jason Oppenheim Net Worth" width=768 height=605 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-300811 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>From 2003 to 2007, Jason was an attorney at the Los Angeles branch of O'Melveny & Myers, an international law firm, and he primarily represented corporate clients. While working for O'Melveny & Myers, Oppenheim represented the Enron Corporation's former CEO in a "multi-billion dollar civil class action" and in the criminal trial against Enron. He also represented the semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices against Intel Corporation in a monopolization lawsuit. Jason's work as an attorney was featured in publications such as "The American Lawyer" and the "Los Angeles Times." Jason left his law career to go into the family business, real estate. He initially worked for Coldwell Banker, where he "quickly established himself as one of the Nation's leading realtors," and after three years in the real estate business, he opened The Oppenheim Group brokerage in West Hollywood. The Oppenheim Group website states that Jason has closed many of the Sunset Strip's highest-priced sales, including "the largest sale ever recorded and the highest-priced sale per sq. ft., the largest Beverly Hills land sale, the highest-priced commercial sale per sq. ft. in Beverly Hills, and the highest-priced sale in Outpost Estates."</p><p>Oppenheim's clients have included celebrities such as <a href=# title="Orlando Bloom Net Worth">Orlando Bloom</a>, <a href=# title="Jessica Alba Net Worth">Jessica Alba</a>, <a href=# title="Taye Diggs Net Worth">Taye Diggs</a>, <a href=# title="Chloë Grace Moretz Net Worth">Chloë Grace Moretz</a>, and <a href=# title="Dakota Johnson Net Worth">Dakota Johnson</a>, and he has been named the Best Real Estate Agent in the United States by the International Property Awards and a Top Real Estate Agent in Los Angeles by "Variety" and "The Hollywood Reporter." In 2019, The Oppenheim Group got its own Netflix reality series, "Selling Sunset, which follows the brokers as they "sell the luxe life to affluent buyers in LA." The series was renewed for its sixth and seventh seasons in June 2022, and it earned Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program in 2021 and 2022. "Selling Sunset" also won an MTV Movie + TV Award for Best Docu-Reality Show in 2022. In 2021, Jason opened a second Opphenheim Group office in Newport Beach, California, and in May 2022, it was announced that the Orange County office would be getting a "Selling Sunset" spin-off, "Selling the OC."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>During the summer of 2021, Jason confirmed that he was dating <a href=#>Chrishell Stause</a>, one of his "Selling Sunset" co-stars, telling "US Weekly," "I care about her deeply and we're very happy together." Oppenheim and Stause split up in December 2021. Chrishell was previously married to actor <a href=#>Justin Hartley</a>, who is best known for starring as Kevin Pearson on the NBC series "This Is Us." In July 2022, Jason was spotted in Greece with model Marie-Lou Nurk, and the two made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of the Netflix film "Day Shift" the following month.</p><h2 id=personal-real-estate><strong>Personal Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2012, Jason paid $4.6 million for a home in the Hollywood Hills. He then spent several million on a variety of dramatic renovations and upgrades. His living room features an 85-inch television that cost $65,000. Oppenheim listed the home for sale for the first time in August 2019 for $7.25 million. He did not find a buyer and instead opted to offer it for rent for $50,000 per month. In October 2020, Jason paid $5.125 million for a new home in Los Angeles, and in November 2021, he purchased a 12,500 square foot home in Newport Beach, California, for $7 million. He also owns a slightly more modest home in the area, which was acquired in April 2021 for $2.8 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97y5qusp2iqHyrrdKopWanoKWyr7TEoqRmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-does-ann-coulter-know-rob-lowe-his-comedy-central-roast-is-a-notable-occasion.html><span>←</span><span>How Does Ann Coulter Know Rob Lowe?
