Dani Alves has played for such clubs as Bahia, Sevilla, Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain, in addition to the Brazilian national team. The most decorated player in football history, he has amassed over 45 official titles including multiple La Liga titles, UEFA Cups, and Copas América. In early 2023, Alves was arrested for raping a woman in a Barcelona nightclub, and was consequently dropped by his club UNAM.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Dani Alves was born on May 6, 1983 in Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil. His father, Domingos, had a passion for football, and organized his own team. Under his father, Alves started out as a winger at the age of six before eventually moving to right-back. He went on to begin his youth career with his hometown club Juazeiro, where he played from 1996 to 1998. Alves then played for the youth division of Bahia from 1998 to 2001.</p><h2 id=bahia-sevilla><strong>Bahia and Sevilla</strong></h2><p>In 2001, Alves made his professional playing debut for Bahia. He immediately established his acumen with the club, winning the Campeonato Baiano and two Northeast Cups. Midway through 2002, Alves was transferred to the Spanish side Sevilla due to his strong performances with Bahia. He had a very impressive six-year tenure with the club, winning the Copa del Rey and two UEFA Cups.</p><h2 id=barcelona-2008-2016><strong>Barcelona, 2008-2016</strong></h2><p>Leaving Sevilla in tears, Alves joined Barcelona in 2008. His first season with the club was an incredible one, as he helped Barcelona win the treble by claiming the La Liga title, Copa del Rey, and European Cup. Alves followed that with another sensational season, again winning the La Liga title and also taking the FIFA Club World Cup. He led Barcelona to a third consecutive Liga title in the 2010-11 season, and also helped the club clinch its fourth European Cup. In the 2011-12 season, Alves and Barcelona won the Copa del Rey and the Club World Cup, and the season after that, claimed another Liga title.</p><p>In 2015, Alves led Barcelona to its fifth European Cup by defeating Juventus. He subsequently signed a two-year contract keeping him with the club until mid-2017. However, Alves ended up leaving Barcelona a year early as a free agent.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-343766 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dani-Alves-1.jpg alt="Dani Alves net worth" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-343766 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=juventus><strong>Juventus</strong></h2><p>Alves signed with Juventus in 2016 on a free transfer. In his first and only season with the club, he won the Serie A title and the Coppa Italia, and helped Juventus reach the Champions League final. His contract was terminated by mutual consent following 33 appearances.</p><h2 id=paris-saint-germain><strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong></h2><p>In the summer of 2017, Alves joined French club Paris Saint-Germain on a free transfer. He had a terrific first season with the club, winning a domestic treble. In his second and final season with PSG, Alves claimed another league title. He became a free agent in 2019 when his contract with the club expired.</p><h2 id=sao-paulo><strong>São Paulo</strong></h2><p>Alves returned to Brazil in 2019 to join São Paulo. His only title with the club came in May of 2021 when he won the Campeonato Paulista, the 42nd title of his career. Following a dispute over unpaid image rights, Alves had his contract terminated later in the year.</p><h2 id=return-barcelona><strong>Return to Barcelona</strong></h2><p>In late 2021, Alves returned to Barcelona. However, he only became available to play in the club's official matches in early 2022. Later, in June, he announced that he was leaving Barcelona for the second time in his career. Overall, Alves made 408 competitive appearances for the club, the second-most by any non-Spanish native.</p><h2 id=unam><strong>UNAM</strong></h2><p>After leaving Barcelona, Alves signed a one-year contract with Liga MX club UNAM. However, after being arrested for allegedly raping a woman in a Barcelona nightclub, he had his contract terminated in early 2023.</p><h2 id=international-playing><strong>International Playing</strong></h2><p>Outside of domestic play, Alves has had a prolific career with the Brazilian national team. His first title with the team was the 2007 Copa América. Two years later, he helped Brazil win the FIFA Confederations Cup, and in 2010 was in Brazil's squad for the FIFA World Cup. In 2013, Alves led Brazil to another Confederations Cup. He was once again part of Brazil's squad the following year in the FIFA World Cup.</p><p>In 2019, Alves led Brazil to another Copa América title. Two years later, he helped Brazil win the gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Next, in 2022, Alves competed in his third FIFA World Cup; this made him the oldest player ever to compete for Brazil in a World Cup match, at the age of 39.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWjpLCksdFom5qmmWKurcLErGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-the-ghostface-killers-in-the-scream-movies-so-far.html><span>←</span><span>All the Ghostface Killers in the 'Scream' Movies so Far</span></a>
