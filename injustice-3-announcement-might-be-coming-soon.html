This is largely due to the fact that the Warner Bros. subsidiary has alternated between creating new installments for both franchises over the last several years, a process which not only leaves room for any post-launch DLC plans, but to give each IP time to rest, preventing fatigue."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This is largely due to the fact that the Warner Bros. subsidiary has alternated between creating new installments for both franchises over the last several years, a process which not only leaves room for any post-launch DLC plans, but to give each IP time to rest, preventing fatigue.</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>It’s worth noting, too, that fighting games in general have much longer shelf lives, so to speak, than those in other genres, often enjoying extended relevance due to their permanent place in the world of eSports. With that said, however, a new DC brawler is on the cusp of being overdue, at least if precedent is any indication. A period of four years has traditionally separated the arrival of new entries for both licenses and Injustice 2 will be exactly that age in just a few months’ time.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/injustice-2-poison-ivy.jpg alt=injustice-2-poison-ivy width=1280 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>With no pre-release reveal to speak of, it’s highly unlikely superhero fans will see Superman, Batman, and countless other crimefighters make a return to the ring in the first half of 2021, but something certainly appears to be afoot. For those that missed it, Microsoft recently added Injustice 2 to Xbox Game Pass. This could well be a complete coincidence, of course, but there’s also a chance, however slim, that this is the first step in a hype-building campaign. Or so says ComicBook.com.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Ultimately, an <strong>Injustice 3</strong> announcement hinges on whether NetherRealm considers its work on Mortal Kombat 11 to be complete. If even more roster additions are announced in the near future, it’s probably safe to assume the former has been pushed by a considerable margin. That’s our take, anyway, but let us know what you think is going on behind the scenes down below!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZooKeipajBqq%2FEZmpmmZ6jvLa6wp6knqakYrCwucinnmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hannah-brown-bachelor-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Hannah Brown (Bachelor) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
