The novel was awarded the annual Michael L. Printz Award by the American Library Association, recognizing the year's "best book written for teens, based entirely on its literary merit." It also appeared on the ALA's annual list, "Top 10 Best Books for Young Adults." The film rights were purchased in 2005 by Paramount, which hired <a href=#>Josh Schwartz</a> as writer and director, but five years later, with no progress on the project, Green told fans that, while he "desperately loved" the screenplay, there seemed to be little interest at Paramount. As sales of Looking for Alaska continued to increase in 2011, Green showed mixed feelings about a movie, which he felt would threaten readers' "intense and private connection to the story." In 2012, the book reached The New York Times Best Seller list for children's paperbacks. Green's second novel, An Abundance of Katherines (Dutton, 2006) was a runner-up for the Printz Award and a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize. In May 2018, it was announced that Looking for Alaska would be made into a Hulu series with Schwartz and others on board. The casting was announced in October 2018. Looking for Alaska was released to Hulu on October 18, 2019.</p><p>In January 2018, Green launched The Anthropocene Reviewed, a new solo podcast in which he reviews things that owe their current existence to the anthropocene, the epoch that includes significant human impact on the environment. This can include completely artificial products like Diet Dr. Pepper, or natural species that have had their fates altered by human influence like the Canada Goose, or phenomena that only influence humanity like Halley's Comet. He reviews two things per monthly episode, giving each a score out of five stars. Since November 2018, the podcast is a co-production of Complexly and WNYC Studios.</p><p>In October 2018, Green founded the Life's Library book club with <a href=#>Rosianna Halse Rojas</a>. The book club reads a book approximately every 6 weeks, with online discussion occurring on the Life's Library Discord. Green and Rojas alternate choosing books, with guest curators occasionally making selections. Life's Library is free to participate in, with paid subscription options available to receive digital or physical subscriptions, containing additional materials such as a discussion podcast, or a version of the book itself. All profits from Life's Library are donated to Partners in Health Sierra Leone to help reduce maternal mortality.</p><p>On June 22, 2017, it was announced that&nbsp;Green's fifth solo novel would be entitled Turtles All The Way Down. It was released on October 10, 2017, and debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list. In December 2017, Green announced that a film adaptation was in development by Fox 2000 and Temple Hill Productions. In May 2018, Green confirmed that the film adaptation would be written by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger, the screenwriters for Love, Simon.</p><p>In September 2015, Green announced that he would be taking a break from social media in order to focus on writing his next book. In August 2016, Green stated that over the next ten months he would be limiting his public appearances in order to finish a draft of the new book. But on September 20, Green took to his YouTube channel to say that he may not publish another book, citing his current writing experience as "this intense pressure, like people were watching over my shoulder while I was writing".</p><p>In 2015, a Tumblr post from user virjn generated media controversy, as it claimed Green is "a creep who panders to teenage girls so that he can amass some weird cult-like following." Other users commented on the post, criticizing his writing and tagging Green to bring the post to his attention. Green responded to the post, defending himself, stating, "Throwing that kind of accusation around is sick and libelous and most importantly damages the discourse around the actual sexual abuse of children." Green added that he would use the social media website less often, stating, "I'm not angry or anything like that. I just need some distance for my well-being." Fellow young-adult authors, <a href=#>Rainbow Rowell</a> and <a href=#>Maggie Stiefvater</a> came to Green's defense. Stiefvater wrote on Tumblr, "You can have your own opinions on Green's books and Internet presence, but the fact remains that he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens. You're not just making sure you can't have nice things. You're taking away other people's nice things." In a subsequent email to USA Today, Stiefvater stated, "I had to say something. Not because of the nature of the posts, although they were distasteful and borderline libel. But because the grotesquerie was being force-fed to the author."</p><p>On July 14, 2015, <a href=#>Greg Ballard</a>, the mayor of Indianapolis, proclaimed that that day would be "John Green Day" in his city. That month, <a href=#>Teresa Jacobs</a>, the mayor of Orange County, Florida, declared that July 17 would also be <a href=#>John Green</a> Day.</p><p>In June 2015, <a href=#>John Green</a> and his brother <a href=#>Hank Green</a> started a weekly podcast titled Dear Hank & John. Taking a mainly humorous tone, each podcast consists of the brothers reading a series of questions submitted by listeners and offering their advice. The podcast closes with a news segment with two standard topics: Mars, presented by Hank, and AFC Wimbledon, presented by John.</p><p>John is an avid fan of Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League and has publicly discussed English football. As of 2015, John is also a shorts and stand sponsor of English League One club AFC Wimbledon, of whom he is also a keen admirer. John has a gaming series on YouTube where he plays FIFA as the "Wimbly Womblys", a fictionalized version of AFC Wimbledon. Advertising revenue from the series is donated to the team. John has also stated that he is a casual supporter of his local American side Indy Eleven, and has been to some of their games.</p><p>In August 2009, Green announced he was writing a new book entitled The Sequel, which was later scrapped. His sixth book, The Fault in Our Stars, was released in January 2012. He crafted the novel by collaborating with Dutton editor <a href=#>Julie Strauss-Gabel</a>. Green explained that several parts of The Sequel were reworked into The Fault in Our Stars. Green signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing and his wife and his brother applied their own symbols, a Yeti and an Anglerfish (known as the "Hanklerfish"), respectively. The New York Times Best Seller list for children's books listed The Fault in Our Stars at number one for two weeks in January and February 2012. The novel has been made into a major motion picture of the same name, released in the United States on June 6, 2014. Green filmed a cameo role for the movie that was not included in the final cut of the film.</p><p>In late 2013, Green stated that he was writing a new book with the working title The Racket. He sold 5,000 words of a rough draft on IndieGoGo for $10 each in order to raise money as part of the Project for Awesome charity event. On November 16, 2014, Green wrote on his Tumblr page that he was not working on The Racket but was working on something else with a different title.</p><p>Young-adult readers and authors, including Green himself, have been critical of the terms. Green has voiced his disagreement with the idea that he is single-handedly responsible for launching or promoting any one individual's career. Green has commented on these arguments: "My concern is that popular work by women receives far more vitriolic criticism from the public (like, in terms of number of demeaning jokes...) than popular work created by men... Also, I would like to see equal attention given to the sexism in popular work by men, from Nicholas Sparks to for instance J. D. Salinger. Catcher in the Rye—although I like it very much—is profoundly and disturbingly misogynistic and yet seems to get a critical pass both online and off. This happens a lot, I think, with books by men, and I don't want male writers (including me!) to get that pass." Relating to this issue, Green has stated that he considers himself to be a feminist.</p><p>Green was the frontman for the YouTube channel for the magazine Mental Floss from 2013 to 2018. He had previously been a contributing writer for the magazine for a period in the mid-2000s. Alongside other presenters, like <a href=#>Craig Benzine</a> and <a href=#>Elliott Morgan</a>, <a href=#>John Green</a> presented "The List Show" in which he listed off interesting facts centered on one particular subject matter, such as "26 amusing facts about amusement parks". These episodes were directed by Mark Olsen and produced by John and <a href=#>Hank Green</a> and Stan Muller. A new format, titled Scatterbrained, was introduced on the channel in 2018; Green was joined by multiple hosts on a single episode each week, which tackled one topic from multiple angles. In 2019, Mental Floss brought its YouTube production in-house and ceased using Green as the host.</p><p>In 2012, following a grant from Google, the brothers launched a pair of short-format educational video series entitled Crash Course, which presents series on World History, American History, Literature (hosted by John), Chemistry, Anatomy & Physiology, Biology, Ecology, Psychology, and Philosophy (hosted by Hank), Astronomy, Games, Big History, Economics, Intellectual Property, Physics, Film History, Mythology, Sociology and Computer Science (hosted by people other than the two brothers).</p><p>After this, Green and his friend, young-adult writer <a href=#>David Levithan</a>, collaborated on the novel Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which was published by Dutton in 2010. It was a runner-up (Honor Book) for two of the annual ALA awards, the Stonewall Book Award (for excellence in LGBT children's and young adult literature), and the Odyssey Award for Excellence in Audiobook Production.</p><p>VidCon is an annual conference for the online video community. The conference was created by the Greens in 2010 in response to the growing online video community. Hank states, "We wanted to get as much of the online video community together, in one place, in the real world for a weekend. It's a celebration of the community, with performances, concerts, and parties; but it's also a discussion of the explosion in community-based online video." The event draws many popular YouTube users, as well as their fans, and provides room for the community to interact. The event also contains an industry conference for people and businesses working in the online video field.</p><p>With fellow young adult authors <a href=#>Maureen Johnson</a> and <a href=#>Lauren Myracle</a>, Green collaborated on Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances (Speak, 2008), which consists of three interconnected short stories, including Green's "A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle," each set in the same small town on Christmas Eve, during a massive snowstorm. In November 2009, the book reached Number 10 on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperback children's books. It was adapted into a film, Let It Snow, by Netflix, which was released in 2019.</p><p>In 2008, Green's third novel, Paper Towns, debuted at number five on The New York Times Best Seller list for children's books, and the novel was made into the 2015 film Paper Towns. In 2009, Paper Towns was awarded the 2009 Edgar Award for Best Young Adult Novel and the 2010 Corine Literature Prize.</p><p>Aside from being a novelist, Green is also well known for his YouTube ventures. In 2007, he launched the Vlogbrothers channel with his brother, <a href=#>Hank Green</a>. Since then, John and Hank have launched events such as Project for Awesome and VidCon and created a total of 11 online series, including Crash Course, an educational channel teaching Literature, History, and Science, later joined by fourteen other courses as of 2018.</p><p>In 2007, John and his brother Hank began a video blog project called Brotherhood 2.0 which ran from January 1 to December 31 of that year. The two agreed that they would forgo all text-based communication with each other for the duration of the project, instead maintaining their relationship by exchanging video blogs, each submitting one to the other on each alternate weekday. These videos were uploaded to a YouTube channel called "vlogbrothers" (as well as the brothers' own website) where they reached a wide audience. In what would have been the project's final video, the brothers revealed that they would extend their video correspondence indefinitely, and as of 2020, they have continued exchanging their unique vlogs.</p><p>In 2007, the Greens introduced the charity project entitled the Project for Awesome (P4A), a project in which YouTube users take two days, traditionally December 17 and 18, to create videos promoting charities or non-profit organizations of their choosing. In 2012, they raised a total of $483,446, surpassing their goal of $100,000. The event has continued annually, gaining more support and higher donations each passing year. In 2015, the grand total of money raised was $1,546,384. Money is raised through donations to an Indiegogo campaign where supporters can pledge money and receive donated perks like signed photographs, books, and art in return. The Green brothers also donate one cent for each comment made on a Project for Awesome video during the event. There is a live stream that lasts for the duration of the Project for Awesome, which is hosted by <a href=#>John Green</a>, <a href=#>Hank Green</a>, and other YouTube personalities.</p><p>Green lives in Indianapolis, Indiana, with his wife, Sarah Urist Green, whom he married on May 21, 2006. She worked as the Curator of Contemporary Art at Indianapolis Museum of Art before leaving to start The Art Assignment, a web series with PBS. In videos on the VlogBrothers channel, <a href=#>Sarah Green</a> is referred to as "the Yeti" due to her not appearing visibly on camera. She made an appearance on YouTube in a Google Hangout video chat with President Obama, during which she and her husband asked the President whether they should name their unborn daughter Eleanor or Alice.</p><p>Green served as an executive producer for the Paper Towns movie. He has also entered into a production deal with the film studio Fox 2000 (which made the adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars). Green announced that Fox 2000 will be making a movie about the formation of AFC Wimbledon, a soccer team that he supports. He will serve as producer along with Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen under their production banner Temple Hill Productions (who produced The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns).</p><p>John Michael Green (born August 24, 1977) is an American author and YouTube content creator. He won the 2006 Printz Award for his debut novel, Looking for Alaska, and his fourth solo novel, The Fault in Our Stars, debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list in January 2012. The 2014 film adaptation opened at number one at the box office. In 2014, Green was included in Time magazine's list of The 100 Most Influential People in the World. Another film based on a Green novel, Paper Towns, was released on July 24, 2015.</p><p>Green was born on August 24, 1977 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Mike and Sydney Green (born 1952). Three weeks after he was born, his family moved to Michigan, then later Birmingham, Alabama, and finally to Orlando, Florida. He attended Glenridge Middle School and Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando. He later attended Indian Springs School outside of Birmingham, Alabama, graduating in 1995. He used Indian Springs as the inspiration for the main setting of his first book, Looking for Alaska. Green graduated from Kenyon College in 2000 with a double major in English and religious studies. He has spoken about being bullied and how it had made life as a teenager miserable for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfn7ypuoygqZ6dnmKutsDHqKk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carson-kressley-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposo-net-worth-familia.html><span>←</span><span>Carson Kressley biografa, edad, altura, esposo, net worth, familia</span></a>
