It’s always been spiked up in some way or form.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_70>DelVecchio’s blowout quickly became his signature look as a roommate on&nbsp;Jersey Shore. When they were out in public, fans would approach DelVecchio and ask to touch his hair. Many fans tried to mimic the look themselves. Today, DelVecchio’s hair continues to be an icon of the MTV series. During an episode of&nbsp;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation, DelVecchio auctioned off the chance to touch his iconic hair to raise money for leukemia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Pauly D tried out a new hairstyle during quarantine</h2><p id=par-4_33>While following stay-at-home orders during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, DelVecchio tried out a new look. After growing out a “quarantine beard,” he gave his followers a glimpse at his face and unstyled hair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_40>“NO GEL! Who Dis??!!” DelVecchio captioned a video post on Instagram that promoted his new TikTok account. The no-gel look shocked and amazed many fans. “Wolverine is your spirit animal,” someone commented. “I like the no gel look!” wrote another.&nbsp;</p><h2>It takes DJ Pauly D almost a half hour to do his hair&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-6_26>Many fans of&nbsp;Jersey Shore&nbsp;have often wondered how long it takes DelVecchio to achieve his iconic hairstyle. “The blowout process is kind of wild,” DelVecchio told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Vulture</a>&nbsp;in 2018.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_21>Perfecting the look is what takes the most effort. Overall, DelVecchio says his blowout hairstyle takes about 25 minutes to complete.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to do your hair like Pauly D</h2><p id=par-8_87>For fans of the blowout, DelVecchio explained how to achieve his iconic look. “It has to be straight from the shower,” he told Vulture. “Your hair has to be clean. I blow-dry it and I use a pick and I pick it up, almost like an Afro — my hair’s really thick. And then I put in the product. [Mine is] like Elmer’s Glue.” DelVecchio uses Spiker brand, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="New York Daily News (opens in a new tab)">New York Daily News</a>. “If you’re not using Spiker, you don’t have a blowout,” he claims.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_51>Then, DelVecchio follows these steps: “I put it all through my hair, spray it, blow-dry it again, and then I use the pick to get those spikes perfect.” To this day, DelVecchio uses the same products to style his hair. “I don’t change,” he said. “I’m like a creature of habit.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3pr7SnrBmq5ikv6Z5x6iuZqyfYsC1xcueZLKnpad6qa3Iq2SloZuaeqW2jKmYrqSpYrGmuNWempygmaR7qcDMpWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./francisco-vilorio-stats-scouting-report-college-baseball-mlb-draft-prospects.html><span>←</span><span>Francisco Vilorio Stats &amp;amp; Scouting Report College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects</span></a>
