She was a staff writer and editor at BuzzFeed for six years and was one of the founding members of their shopping vertical. Her work has appeared in Allure, Nylon, Rolling Stone, Fodor’s Travel, and InStyle. She was the recipient of the Ed2020 Trust Fund, a scholarship meant for extraordinary intern work in the media field.</p><p>When she’s not scrolling through TikTok and saving recipes she’ll never recreate, AnaMaria’s interests include long walks, listening to murder podcasts, staring at her dog, and starting (but almost never finishing) new TV shows. She’s an avid traveler with an ever-increasing bucket list. Her dream destinations include Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. Her favorite cities are Tucson, New Orleans, Madeira, Palermo, and Aswan.</p><p>She’s a native New Yorker and rarely shuts up about it, though she spends her summers with family in Croatia.
