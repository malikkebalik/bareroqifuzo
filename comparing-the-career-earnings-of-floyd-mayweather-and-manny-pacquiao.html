<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Comparing The Career Earnings Of Floyd Mayweather And Manny Pacquiao</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>On May 2, 2015, <a title="Floyd Mayweather Net Worth" href=#>Floyd Mayweather</a> and <a title="Manny Pacquiao Net Worth" href=#>Manny Pacquiao</a> will FINALLY step into the ring together to face off in what is easily the most highly anticipated boxing match in history. That's 41 days from right now. This is a fight that is six years in the making. Negotiations were first attempted back in mid-2009! As you can probably imagine, everyone pretty much&nbsp;expects that the bout will absolutely&nbsp;demolish the current record for PPV purchases. That PPV record, 2.4 million buys, occurred when Floyd fought Oscar De La Hoya back in 2007. Ticket prices range from $3500 to $250,000. Most experts believe this will be the richest fight in history, potentially generating in excess of <strong>$400 million</strong>.</p><p>According to the contract, the revenue split will go 60-40, in favor of Floyd. On the high end, it's estimated that Floyd will earn $150 million for the fight and Manny will earn $100 million. On the low end, they will take home $120 million and $80 million, respectively.</p><p>Vegas odds as of this writing would require a bettor to put up $285 to win $100 on Mayweather. A $100 bet in favor of Manny would win $225 if he is victorious.</p><p>We will be writing more detailed articles on the economics of this fight in the near future. For now, I just wanted to take a quick look back at the career earnings of both fighters:</p><p><strong>Floyd's Career Earnings:</strong></p><ul><ul><li>Carlos Baldomir November 4, 2006 – $8 million</li><li>Oscar De La Hoya May 5, 2007 – $25 million</li><li><a href=# title="Ricky Hatton Net Worth">Ricky Hatton</a> December 8, 2007 – $25 million</li><li>World Wrestling Entertainment Appearance – $20 million</li><li><a href=# title="Juan Manuel Marquez Net Worth">Juan Manuel Márquez</a> September 19, 2009 – $25 million</li><li><a href=#>Sugar Shane Mosley</a> May 14th, 2010 – $30 million</li><li><a href=# title="Victor Ortiz Net Worth">Victor Ortiz</a> September 17th, 2011 – $40 million</li><li><a href=# title="Miguel Cotto Net Worth">Miguel Cotto</a> May 5, 2012 – $40 million</li><li><a href=# title="Robert Guerrero Net Worth">Robert Guerrero</a> May 4, 2013 – $50 million</li><li><a href=# title="Saul Alvarez Net Worth">Saul Alvarez</a> September 14, 2013 – $75 million</li><li><a href=# title="Marcos Maidana Net Worth">Marcos Maidana</a> May 2, 2014 – $40 million</li><li>Marcos Maidana September 13, 2014 – $32 million</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Total Career Earnings: $430 million</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-142023 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/floy.jpg alt="(JOHN GURZINSKI/AFP/Getty Images)" width=670 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-142023 class=wp-caption-text>(JOHN GURZINSKI/AFP/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Manny's Career Earnings:</strong></p><ul><ul><li>$2 million – against <a href=# title="Erik Morales Net Worth">Erik Morales</a> (January 2006)</li><li>$1 million – against Oscar Larios (July 2006)</li><li>$3 million – against Erik Morales (November 2006)</li><li>$2 million – against Jorge Solis (April 2007)</li><li>$2 million – against Marco Antonio Barrera (October 2007)</li><li>$11 million – against <a href=#>Oscar De la Hoya</a> (December 2008)</li><li>$12 million – against Ricky Hatton (May 2009)</li><li>$35 million – against Miguel Cotto (November 2009)</li><li>$35 million – against <a href=# title="Antonio Margarito Net Worth">Antonio Margarito</a> (November 2010)</li><li>$20 million – against Shane Mosely (May 2011)</li><li>$20 million – against Juan Manuel Marquez (November 2011)</li><li>$20 million – against <a href=# title="Timothy Bradley Net Worth">Timothy Bradley</a> (June 2012)</li><li>$30 million – against Juan Manuel Marquez (December 2012)</li><li>$30 million – against <a href=# title="Brandon Rios Net Worth">Brandon Rios</a> (November 2013)</li><li>$20 million – against Timothy Bradley (April 2014)</li><li>$20 million – against Chris Algieri (November 2014)</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Total career earnings: $263 million</strong></p><p>Assuming May 2nd goes off without a hitch, Floyd will add $150 million to his career total, bringing him up to <strong>$580 million</strong>.
