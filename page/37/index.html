James Gunn has come clean and admitted that superhero fatigue is a very real thing, with the departing Marvel Cinematic Universe veteran and co-CEO of DC Studios even underlining the problems that have dogged countless comic book blockbusters over the years, so hopes were high that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 would be a return to form.
