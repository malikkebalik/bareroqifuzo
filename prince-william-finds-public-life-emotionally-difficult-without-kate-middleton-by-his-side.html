The couple have worked as a team for over a decade.</p><p id=par-3_31>Russell said public life is “emotionally very difficult” without Kate by his side. “At the moment, we are seeing the Prince of Wales perform his public duties in an exemplary manner.”</p><p id=par-4_59>The commentator continued, “There’s a huge amount of public approval for how he’s handled them. However, that’s not to say that it’s not emotionally very difficult to be without his wife in public, as they often perform together, and obviously to be dealing with the emotional strain and distress that having a loved one with cancer brings to anyone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-prince-william-could-be-dealing-privately-with-some-strong-emotions>Prince William could be ‘dealing privately’ with some ‘strong emotions’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Prince-William-and-Kate-Middleton-who-sent-a-message-with-Prince-Williams-birthday-photo.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-5_39>Gareth Russell continued that Prince William could be “dealing privately” with some “strong emotions” as Kate Middleton <a href=#>continues her cancer treatment</a>. The prince must tend to his wife and their shared children and fulfill his duty to the country.</p><p id=par-6_43>Russell states, “We have seen the Prince of Wales perform as a father with the children, things like the Taylor Swift concert, in a way that puts the children first. We’ve also seen him behave with eloquence, confidence, and dignity at public events.”</p><p id=par-7_39>However, despite his brave face, Prince William could be dealing with some challenging emotions as his partner of almost 20 years fights her <a href=#>cancer battle</a>. Russell believes that William is trying to backburner his feelings, but for how long?</p><p id=par-8_41>“This could still be someone who’s dealing privately with some very strong emotions,” the royal commentator claims. “At the minute, the approval records are pretty clear that the public does feel he’s doing a very good job in very difficult circumstances.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-will-kate-middleton-return-to-prince-william-s-side-in-a-more-public-fashion>When will Kate Middleton return to Prince William’s side in a more public fashion?</h2><p id=par-9_47>After six months out of the public eye, Kate Middleton joined Prince William and their children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping the Color. It was the first time the entire Wales family was seen publicly since Christmas 2023.</p><p id=par-10_26>Kate updated the public with the latest information <a href=#>regarding her health</a> in a June <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post. She shared details of her cancer treatment and ongoing recovery.</p><p id=par-11_60>“I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days. On those bad days, you feel weak and tired, and you have to give in to your body resting. But on the good days, when you feel stronger, you want to make the most of feeling well,” the princess began.</p><p id=par-12_53>“My treatment is ongoing and will be for a few more months. On the days I feel well enough, it is a joy to engage with school life, spend personal time on the things that give me energy and positivity, as well as starting to do a little work from home,” Kate continued.</p><p id=par-13_32>She concluded, “I am learning how to be patient, especially with uncertainty. Taking each day as it comes, listening to my body, and allowing myself to take this much-needed time to heal.”</p><p id=par-14_21>Prince William continues to keep his scheduled public appearances. Kate Middleton will appear at select royal events in the coming months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s7XNnJxmr5mhuaqtzGadoqaUqHqxwcGloJxlnJ6zpnnEpqatoZ%2Bjrq242Gabop6WnrC2uNNmrqKsmKTCtXnKmqueZZ2esaW4xK2mp2WjnrGmesetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-starr-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Starr Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
