For me, it was extreme highs in my career and extreme lows in a relationship. There were really obvious things to write about.”</span></p><p><span><strong>At the time of the band’s second album <a href=# rel=noopener>King said</a>:</strong></span></p><p><span>&nbsp;“A lot of really big realizations about ourselves are on this record. We’re singing about real things that we’ve experienced. I’m not really comfortable talking about it, but I’m a lot more comfortable singing about it. It’s a different side of me.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Who-is-Joe-king-1.webp><p><span>When he was only 19 he got married to Julie and the couple had two daughters Elise Madison King and Ava Julie King.
