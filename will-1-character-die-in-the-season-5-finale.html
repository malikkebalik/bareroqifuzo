However, it’s not clear why she reaches out to Tim. Elsewhere in episode 20, Skip Tracer Randy contacts Nyla Harper and John Nolan when he finds himself being framed for murder.</p><p id=par-6_34>Episode 21, “Going Under,” will then premiere on Tuesday, April 25. And The Rookie Season 5 finale (which doesn’t have a title yet) drops on Tuesday, May 2, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>A leaked photo shows one member of ‘The Rookie’ cast in danger</h2><p id=par-7_29><a href=#>The Rookie cast</a> and crew finished filming the season 5 finale weeks ago, and on March 14, one fan posted a behind-the-scenes photo from the upcoming episode on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>.</p><p id=par-8_53>The picture depicts a crew member holding up a film slate (that reads “522,” confirming that it’s from the finale) in front of a scene in a hospital. An unknown character lies on a table in an operating room as surgeons loom over them. And it looks like they’re getting a blood transfusion.</p><p id=par-9_39>Unfortunately, we can’t see the character’s face, but the photo shows their hand hanging off the table. So The Rookie fans were able to narrow down the possible suspects to two main characters — Sergeant Grey and Aaron Thorsen.</p><p id=par-10_57>Of course, the person in surgery could be a minor character. However, given that the picture is from the finale, it’s easy for fans to jump to conclusions and assume that an important person’s life is in danger. But what happened to them? And what is the probability of them dying in The Rookie Season 5 finale?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2>Will a main character die in ‘The Rookie’ Season 5 finale?</h2><p id=par-11_74>As we mentioned above, The Rookie isn’t afraid to kill any of its main characters (the only one who is likely safe from any serious harm is John Nolan). Captain Zoe Andersen, played by Mercedes Mason, died in The Rookie Season 1 after getting shot in the neck. And <a href=#>Jackson West, played by Titus Makin Jr.</a>, died in The Rookie Season 4 premiere after one of La Fiera’s men shot him in the back.</p><p id=par-12_22>Plus, a handful of other recurring characters have died in the show, including Annie Wersching’s Rosalind Dyer and Harold Perrineau’s Nick Armstrong.</p><p id=par-13_35>So it wouldn’t be shocking if another character’s life is in danger in the season 5 finale. However, we will have to wait until the episode premieres to understand the truth behind the leaked photo.</p><p id=par-14_12>The Rookie Season 5 airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMq6aoo5maerS8zqKjnqqjYsSquMtmaGabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlmnJmaerSxwKymp2VlYrOqusClnGegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-kingdoms-of-ruin-anime-plot-release-window-voice-cast-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>The Kingdoms of Ruin anime plot, release window, voice cast, and more</span></a>
