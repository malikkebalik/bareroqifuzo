They have five children Ridge, Thorne, Kristen, Felicia and Angela together. Eric serves as the chief designer of their growing fashion enterprise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Eric-Forrester-2.jpg><p>Eric’s life has a number of ups and downs throughout the course of the series. His family is affected by two big retcons: first, the finding that Angela, whom he thought to be his daughter was actually a forger and second, the revelation that Massimo Marone, a shipping billionaire and not Eric is Ridge’s biological father.</p><p>There are difficulties in Eric and Stephanie’s marriage, including moments of tension and infidelity. Their relationship suffers as a result of Stephanie’s concerns that Eric was having an affair with Margo Lynley, his personal assistant.</p><p>Because she thinks Margo works overtime at the office hoping to spend more time with her boss Eric Forrester:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The bold and the beautiful 1987<br>Margo works overtime at the office hoping to spend more time with her boss Eric Forrester<a href=# rel=noopener>#laurenkoslow</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#johnmccook</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#BB</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>#boldandbeautiful</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eXgH3mSuUr</a></p><p>— michelatognetti (@mikytognetti) <a href=# rel=noopener>June 19, 2023</a></p><p>When Stephanie is replaced by Beth Logan, however, their relationship is put to the test even further, leading to a savage rivalry between the two women. When Eric discovers that Stephanie has concealed Angela, his 24-year-old daughter, because of her severe disabilities, from him the drama is heightened.</p><p>Stephanie had kept her hidden.

His interactions with these women are crucial to the drama and storylines of the show.&nbsp;Particularly after Stephanie’s death, Eric’s character changes significantly.</p><p>He becomes one of the series’ most enduring and important characters thanks to his path, which is characterized by love, betrayal, forgiveness, and resiliency.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Follow us on Twitter</a> and check out our latest posts related to these kinds of topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgbXxzg46iqmadop6wbrLOq6meq6Sav264xJqtoqaXYsGpsYybpqWcXZa7pXnToZxmmpWWwrW1xa6jaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6-midsommar-halloween-costume-ideas-that-ll-change-how-you-wear-flower-crowns.html><span>←</span><span>6 Midsommar Halloween Costume Ideas Thatll Change How You Wear Flower Crowns</span></a>
