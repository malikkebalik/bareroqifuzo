There have been many stories over the years that he was secretly married, but this is inaccurate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/M-Lamar.jpg><p>In spite of the fact that he has had s*xual intercourse with boys, Lamar does not identify as gἀy. He has always defined being gἀy differently than how others have in the past. He made it plain in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of the interviews</a> that he would enter into a relationship with anyone, whether they were females, boys or queers. He stated:</p><p>“I have a longtime boyfriend. But in gἀy land, I was never getting my needs met s*xually. I don’t define myself as gἀy…in a good way. It wasn’t about a boyfriend always. In the scenes I was in, people just hooked up randomly. It could be with a boy or a girl. It was all good. I always had game too laughs!”&nbsp;</p><p>He continued:</p><p>“Everyone can define themselves however they want. I’ve chosen to reject gἀy as a term for myself. I’m interested in the behavior of s*xuality.”</p><p><strong>In our previous posts, we covered other stars.

Lamar has openly acknowledged having boyfriends in the past, even if it is unknown if he is dἀting anyone right now. He even made reference to his partner in a tweet from 2020.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>My boyfriend was just telling me that people who have experienced a lot of trauma in there lives may have an easier time adjusting to this new reality.
