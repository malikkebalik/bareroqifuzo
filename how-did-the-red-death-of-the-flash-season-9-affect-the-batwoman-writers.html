<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>How Did the Red Death of The Flash Season 9 Affect the Batwoman Writers?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The writers of Batwoman discuss the shocking revelation of the Red Death in the third episode of The Flash season nine. The Flash’s last season will go out with a bang as it chronicles Barry Allen’s final year in the Arrowverse.</p><p><strong>Red Death, a villain whose presence has been long anticipated finally made an appearance in season 9 of The Flash.</strong> But the TV version of DC Comics is going in a different direction than the comics.</p><p>A well-known member of the Arrowverse is playing the role of Red Death in The Flash, despite the fact that in the canon he is an alternate Bruce Wayne.</p><p>Red Death revealed herself to be Ryan Wilder in the climactic moments of episode 3 of season 9 of The Flash. Since Batwoman Season 3 concluded, this is her first appearance in the Arrowverse.</p><p>Batwoman writers posted a Tweet on their official Twitter account and said: “Our Hero is Back on TV”.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Shoutout to <a href=# rel=noopener>@ewrote</a> for making us sob and tear up by seeing our hero back on TV. Eric, we owe you a platter of cookies and a dozen balloons.</p><p>— Batwoman Writers Room (@BatwomanWriters) <a href=# rel=noopener>February 23, 2023</a></p><p>The Batwoman staff weighed in on the return of Leslie as the internet discussed the unveiling of the Red Death. The account expressed gratitude to Eric Wallace, the showrunner of The Flash, for including their main character in the series’ final season.</p><p>They also expressed appreciation to the writers of The Flash for reintroducing Ryan to the Arrowverse.<strong> Red Death is Ryan, but it’s not clear which Batwoman this is meant to represent.</strong> In episode 3 of The Flash season 9, titled “Rogues of War” we learn that Ryan disappeared weeks ago while on a mission.</p><p><strong>Must Check our previously covered articles:</strong></p><h2>The Flash Features the Terrifying Appearance of the Red Death</h2><p><strong>Red Death first appeared in Central City not long after, setting up this week’s big reveal.</strong> However, Ryan’s whereabouts are unknown because Red Death might not be Batwoman from Earth Prime. Since the comic book version of Red Death is Batman from a parallel universe, it’s possible that’s the direction The Flash will take.</p><p>If this Ryan exists, he must be from another dimension or a different timeline. If this is a double, then she may or may not be responsible for the abduction of Batwoman from Earth Prime.</p><p>Due to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Arrowvere instituted a new rule which stated that there could be only one version of a person on any given Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Flash-Season-9-Red-Death-Reveal-1.jpg><p><strong>Since there are only two episodes left in the Red Death arc, Season 9 of The Flash will be concluding the mystery very soon</strong>. Given that “The Mask of Red Death” consists of a two-part episode (parts 4 and 5), we can expect to learn more about her history in the episode airing next week.</p><p>Then, it looks like Barry and this iteration of Ryan will finally face off in The Flash season 9, episode 5. Season 9 of The Flash, hopefully, will deliver a satisfying conclusion to the Red Death storyline, which has been heavily teased in recent episodes.</p><p>All the information you need about your favorite shows and series is right here.
