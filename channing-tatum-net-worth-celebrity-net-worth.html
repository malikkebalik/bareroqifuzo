Channing Tatum is consistently a very highly-paid actor and has been the highest paid actor in the world on at least one occasion thanks to an extremely lucrative deal that paid off handsomely for the film "Magic Mike." More info on his Magic Mike payday below but, spoiler alert, <a href=#>Channing earned around $90 million</a> pre-tax (pre-divorce) from the two Magic Mike films. Channing Tatum first gained attention appearing in the romantic comedy based on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," called, "She's the Man." He then gained critical attention for his performance in the independent film, "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints," playing the brooding, troubled best friend of <a href=# title="Shia LaBeouf Net Worth">Shia LaBeouf</a>'s character. However, it was not until his performance in the surprise hit film, "Step Up," that everyone started to pay attention.</p><h2 id=early-life><b>Early Life</b></h2><p><b></b>Channing Tatum was born on April 26 1980 in Cullman, Alabama, the son of Kay Tatum and Glenn Tatum (an airline worker and construction builder, respectively). He was raised in a rural setting in the bayous of Mississippi near the Mississippi River. He was active in sports growing up and had trouble with schoolwork due to a diagnosis of ADD and Dyslexia. Tatum attended Gaither High School in Tampa, Florida and Glenville State College in West Virginia on a football scholarship. He later dropped out to return home, where he worked odd jobs. He started as a roofer, and then eventually became a stripper at a local nightclub under the pseudonym Chan Crawford.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-334177 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Channing-Tatum.jpg alt="Channing Tatum Net Worth" width=900 height=869 sizes="(max-width: 1529px) 100vw, 1529px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-334177 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><b>Career</b></h2><p>Tatum's first taste of showbiz came when he was cast as a dancer in <a href=# title="Ricky Martin Net Worth">Ricky Martin</a>'s "She Bangs" video in 2000, and was paid $400 for the job. He was discovered by a model talent scout, and was signed with Page 305 Modeling Agency. He began to model for big names like Gap, Armani, Dolce & Gabbana, and Abercrombie & Fitch, and then eventually moved into national TV ads for Mountain Dew and Pepsi in 2002. Tatum signed with Ford Models in New York City and continued to work with them until he began to pursue acting roles.</p><p>Channing's first movie role was opposite <a href=# title="Amanda Bynes Net Worth">Amanda Bynes</a> in "She's the Man" (2006).

He and his wife (Jenna Dewan) and Reid Carolin, their production partner, signed a production deal with Relativity Media for any movies developed during that time.</p><p>2012 was a huge year for Tatum. He co-starred in <a href=# title="Steven Soderbergh Net Worth">Steven Soderbergh</a>'s Haywire, starred with <a href=# title="Rachel McAdams Net Worth">Rachel McAdams</a> in "The Vow," and co-starred with <a href=# title="Jonah Hill Net Worth">Jonah Hill</a> in "21 Jump Street." In addition, he played the title role in the critically and audience acclaimed hit "Magic Mike," a role that catapulted him to the spotlight.

The film also starred <a href=# title="Joe Manganiello Net Worth">Joe Manganiello</a> and <a href=#>Matthew McConaughey</a>.

Instead of financing the movie in a traditional system, where a movie studio puts up the money and takes all the profits, Channing and fellow producer Steven Soderbergh financed the $7 million budget themselves and paid Warner Brothers a flat fee to distribute the movie. Magic Mike was a smash hit in terms of box office receipts, streaming and DVD sales. The result was both <a href=#>Channing and Soderberg earning $60 million</a>. The duo earned another $30 million a piece from the second movie.</p><h2 id=red-shirt-payday><strong>Red Shirt Payday</strong></h2><p>Channing Tatum was paid $25 million to star in the Amazon original film "Red Shirt." which was written by <a href=#>Simon Kinberg</a>.

Since they were married during some extremely successful years for Channing, Jenna is believed to have been paid a <a href=#>divorce settlement in the $20-30 million</a> range including real estate and ongoing spousal support.</p><p>In 2018, Tatum began dating singer <a href=# title="Jessie J Net Worth">Jessie J</a>.
