Even after he was knocked down through the ropes and was only partially conscious and staggering back to his feet when Lipton gave the order to continue, he continued to fight. Lipton should have intervened sooner, but he waited until three inspectors from the New York State Commission and ringside doctors went onto the apron to call a halt to the fight.</p><p>At 2:06 of the second round, the referee called a halt to the fight, and Vargas was taken to Bellevue Hospital for observation.</p><p>Worryingly, this comes only days after South African boxer Simiso Buthelezi passed away after suffering a brain bleed during a battle in Durban against Siphesihle Mntungwa.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Very scary in South Africa please üôèüèº for Simiso Buthelezi (4-1).

The 24-year-old was taken to the hospital and put into an induced coma after the referee called an end to the battle. On Wednesday, news spread across the boxing community that he had died as a result of his wounds.</p><p>Sadly, it has been reported that his opponent, Siphesihle Mntungwa, is on the verge of suicide due to the barrage of hate he has received since Buthelezi‚Äôs death. After the sad event, he alleges that even his neighbors turned against him.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>South African boxer Siphesihle Mntungwa has said he‚Äôs received mass abuse after Simiso Buthelezi died following their fight: ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt take it anymore.

However, this is hardly a question of life and death. The referee‚Äôs top priority should always be the safety of the combatant. Nothing else matters at this time. A referee of Ron Lipton‚Äôs experience should have known better than to allow this to continue.</p><p><strong>Did you watch Game 6 of Dallas?</strong> If not then you can read about all the highlights we have covered about the match in the below post:</p><p>The referee, however, does not stand alone in this situation. Josue Vargas‚Äôs camp as a whole needs to have its credentials revoked. They were solely concerned with winning and didn‚Äôt give a hoot about their man‚Äôs safety. The fight should have been stopped when the corner representing Vargas threw all of their towels in the referee‚Äôs face.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Whats a fucking unexpected stoppage!!!!
