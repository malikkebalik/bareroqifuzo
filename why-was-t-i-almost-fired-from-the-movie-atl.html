The film was the feature film debut of<a href=#> rapper Tip “T.I.” Harris </a>and it propelled actress Lauren London onto the main stage. Set in Atlanta and often at the infamous Cascade skating rink –the film follows T.I’s character Rashad –a high school senior, his rag-tag group of friends, and his little brother Ant (Evan Ross).</p><p id=par-2_84>A talented cartoonist– Rashad doesn’t see too much of a future for himself. Instead, he focuses all of his energy towards his little brother while working with his uncle to clean offices at night. However, when he meets a new girl, New New (London)–his eyes open up to what the world can actually offer him. Though the film premiered way back in 2006 — there are still whispers of a possible sequel. However, T.I. almost got fired from ATL before it was even finished.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>Why was T.I. nearly fired from ATL?</h2><p id=par-3_94>By the time he began filming ATL –T.I. whose given name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. was already well known in the music industry. Though they’re both entertainment- based –music is very different from film, and T.I. just didn’t have the discipline required at first to be on a movie set. At the time–the rapper was also recording his fourth studio album, King which would become the breakthrough album for him. Time management was not his strong suit. <a href=#>During an interview with Jemele Hill for her podcast, </a><a href=#>Jemele Hill is Unbothered</a><a href=#>, T.I. explained</a>,</p><p>I almost got fired three times…quit two times, I was having the time of my life and getting money hand over fist. They paid me $85,000 to do ATL, and not just the filming part. There was weeks, if not months of consistent skate training. I was living the lifestyle and I didn’t understand the magnitude of what the film industry entails. I was late the first four days. I was 30 minutes late the first two days. The third and the fourth day, I might have been 15 minutes late and thought I was doing better.</p><p id=par-4_35>Luckily director Chris Robinson and actor Charles “Charlie Mack” Alston sat T.I. down and explained to him why being late was unacceptable, and he was able to get it together and finish the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2>What other movies and TV shows has T.I. been in?</h2><p id=par-5_42>Luckily ATL was a smash success, and it propelled T.I. into a whole new sector of the entertainment industry. He’s appeared in films like American Gangster, Takers, the Entourage movie, <a href=#>Ant-Man</a><a href=#>, </a><a href=#>Ant-Man and the Wasp</a> and a slew of others.</p><p id=par-6_32>The Paper Trail rapper has also found success on TV shows– on his reality series T.I. & Tiny: The Family Hustle, the Grand Hustle and in the History Channel’s remake of Roots.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2>What is T.I.’s net worth?</h2><p id=par-7_41>The $85,000 T.I. made for ATL was only the beginning of the rapper/actor massive’s worth. <a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, T.I. is worth $50 million, and with countless forthcoming projects, we don’t think he’ll be slowing down anytime soon.</p><p id=par-8_5>Check out&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Cheat Sheet</a>&nbsp;on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2ForzPnqlmrJlirq25zqyrZp6Zp7KlecWrpqZlnaTDqrGMmqulZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./show-yoh-parents-ethnicity-and-religion-real-name-and-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Show Yoh Parents Ethnicity And Religion: Real Name And Biography</span></a>
