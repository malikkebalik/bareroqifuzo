This is significantly higher than the national average of 0.46% APY.</p><p>Capital One pays much higher rates than you'll earn with brick-and-mortar banks. You may find better rates at other online banks, but because rates fluctuate, the bank with the highest rate will depend on when you look.</p><h3 data-toc-label="Pros and Cons" id=pros-and-cons class=toc-anchor>Capital One Savings Pros and Cons</h3><p class=headline-bold>Compare Today's Savings Rates</p><h3 data-toc-label="How Capital One Savings Rates Compare" id=how-capital-one-savings-rates-compare class=toc-anchor>How Capital One Savings Rates Compare</h3><p><strong>Capital One Savings vs. Ally Savings&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Ally savings rates</a> work similarly to the rates at Capital One. Both pay above the national average on all balances, compound interest daily, and pay interest monthly. Currently, the Ally Savings Account pays 4.35% APY, which is similar to the Capital One 360 Performance Savings.</p><p>Both banks also have savings features that allow you to set multiple savings goals in one account. For example, you could create a goal to set aside money for "Emergency Savings" and "Travel Fund," and track your progress over time.</p><p>Your choice between the two banks may ultimately depend on what you prioritize in your banking experience.</p><p>Capital One is considered an online bank, but it also has over 280 branches in eight US states and DC. You might prefer Capital One if you live near a branch and want the option to speak with a banker face-to-face.</p><p>If you'd like to open other types of savings accounts, also note that Ally has a money market account while Capital One doesn't.</p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Ally Bank Review</a></p><p><strong>Capital One Savings vs. CIT Bank Savings</strong></p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>CIT Bank high-yield savings</a> accounts are competitive. You can choose between two savings accounts: CIT Bank Savings Connect and CIT Platinum Savings. CIT Bank Savings Connect pays 4.65% APY regardless of your account balance. Meanwhile, the <a rel="nofollow noopener" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-analytics-product-id=641dd68d780d2a001833cbf9 data-analytics-product-brand="CIT Bank" data-analytics-product-name="CIT Bank Platinum Savings" href=#>CIT Bank Platinum Savings</a> may be better for higher account balances since it pays 5.05% APY on balances of $5,000 or more.</p><p>Keep in mind that savings rates fluctuate, so just because one bank pays higher rates now doesn't mean that will always be the case.</p><p>If you'd like to open a savings account with a $0 minimum opening deposit, Capital One will likely stand out to you more.</p><p><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>CIT Bank Review</a></p><p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Capital One 360 Performance Savings may be a great option if you're looking for an account with a $0 minimum opening deposit and no monthly service fees. It also offers a solid rate, but bear in mind the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>best high-yield savings accounts</a> may offer even higher interest rates right now.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-toc-label="Why You Should Trust Us" id=why-you-should-trust-us class=toc-anchor><strong>Why You Should Trust Us: How We Reviewed Capital One 360 Performance Savings</strong></h3><p>We rate bank accounts on a scale from zero to five stars.
