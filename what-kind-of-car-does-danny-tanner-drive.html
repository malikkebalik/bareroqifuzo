He gave iconic dad talks to his three daughters, Michelle, Stephanie, and DJ. He also had a <a href=#>red convertible</a> that made an appearance in the <a href=#>Full House</a> introduction.</p><p id=par-2_18>Here’s what we know about this car and why it only appeared in the early Full House seasons.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Full-House.jpg><p id=par-3_48>He loved to clean. <a href=#>Bob Saget</a> appeared as Danny Tanner for most episodes of this sitcom, later returning for the spinoff Fuller House. He acted as a father to his daughters Michelle, Stephanie, and DJ, as well as the co-host of the morning show, Wake Up, San Francisco.</p><p id=par-4_49>Danny Tanner was also a best friend to the characters named <a href=#>Joey Gladstone</a> and Jesse Katsopolis. Aside from his love for cleaning, Danny Tanner had a deep love and appreciation for his car named Bullet. This vehicle is the same car that appeared in the introduction to Full House.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-kind-of-car-does-danny-tanner-drive>What kind of car does Danny Tanner drive?</h2><p id=par-5_34>In addition to the iconic theme song, most know the Full House introduction to include Danny Tanner’s packed car. That’s his prized possession — a red 1961 Oldsmobile 88 that he affectionately nicknamed Bullet.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_49>This was the same car that Uncle Jesse accidentally totaled during the first season of this sitcom. Fortunately, though, Jesse and Joey were able to find a replica at a local car dealership. After that, a few other cars appeared in Full House, especially as the Tanner sisters grew.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-there-are-several-car-themed-episodes-in-this-comedy-series>There are several car-themed episodes in this comedy series&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-7_34>Danny Tanner’s car wouldn’t be the only vehicle featured in the sitcom. During the “Honey, I Broke the House” episode of Full House, Stephanie accidentally started Joey’s car that was parked in the backyard.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_57>She switched the gear shifter to “R” for “radio.” Little did she know that the “R” stood for “reverse.” The car went right through the kitchen window, prompting Michelle Tanner’s jaw to drop and yell, “there’s a car in the kitchen!” As an adult in Fuller House, Stephanie Tanner accidentally drove Joey’s car through the kitchen again.</p><p id=par-9_47>During the “Driving Miss DJ” episode, Uncle Jesse decided to take DJ out for driving lessons. With DJ in the driver’s seat of the Mustang, Jesse’s best advice was to “feel the vibrations” of the car. Unfortunately, that led her to scratch the side of the car.</p><p id=par-10_37>For DJ’s 16th birthday, Joey gifted this character a red 1977 Pontiac Firebird. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Joey, this car was actually stolen, and DJ Tanner wasn’t allowed to keep it. It was the thought that counted, though!</p><p id=par-11_29>Most episodes of Full House are available for streaming on Hulu. All five seasons of the Netflix original spinoff series, Fuller House, are available on the streaming platform, Netflix.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSztrjLZp%2BoraOaeqy1zZ1knJmiYrGius2yZK2ZnqOys3nDq6CvnV6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nathan-fillion-and-stana-katic-disagreed-on-becoming-a-couple-in-castle.html><span>←</span><span>Nathan Fillion and Stana Katic Disagreed on Becoming a Couple in Castle</span></a>
