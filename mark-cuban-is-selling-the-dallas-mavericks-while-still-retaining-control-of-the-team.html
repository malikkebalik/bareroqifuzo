<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Mark Cuban Is Selling The Dallas MavericksWhile Still Retaining Control Of The Team</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span style=font-weight:400>For nearly a quarter century, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Mark Cuban</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> has been a familiar face at Dallas Mavericks games. He purchased the team in 2000 when they had young, talented players </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Dirk Nowitzki</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Steve Nash</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. The Mavericks eventually lost Nash, but Nowitzki became a legend in Dallas sports. The Mavericks reached the NBA Finals in 2006 and won a championship in 2011. After some lean years, they're hoping to rebuild around </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Luka Doncic</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Kyrie Irving</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They're going to be doing it under a different owner, however. As NBA insider Shams Charania </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>reported</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, Cuban is selling a majority stake in the Mavericks to </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Miriam Adelson</span></a>,<span style=font-weight:400> a physician and casino heiress of Las Vegas Sands. The valuation of the sale is worth $3.5 billion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Here's where the deal takes a fascinating turn: Cuban will still retain full control of basketball operations for the Mavericks. He'll also keep an undisclosed amount of shares in the team.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Typically, when an owner sells their stake, they're removed from most, if not all, team activities. But Cuban has always prided himself on doing things a bit differently.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-354858 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1808859733.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-354858 class=wp-caption-text>Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It's a wild financial gain for Cuban, who bought the Mavericks in January 2000 for $285 million. In April of the previous year, he sold the company he founded, Broadcast.net (formerly AudioNet), to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. Mark famously hedged his share of the $5.7 billion through options, locking in $1.4 billion in proceeds. Had he not done this, his Yahoo shares would have lost 90% of their value in just a few months.</span></p><p>With today's sale and his other portfolio of assets, Mark Cuban's net worth is $6.5 billion.</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Cuban </span><span style=font-weight:400>also recently announced</span><span style=font-weight:400> that he's planning to leave </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Shark Tank</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, the hit show that features entrepreneurs pitching their products to wealthy investors. To date, </span><span style=font-weight:400>Cuban has invested</span><span style=font-weight:400> about $20 million in 85 deals across 111 episodes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Cuban's plan is to film season 16, then call it quits. That will put him at a dozen seasons for his </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Shark Tank </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>career. While there's speculation that the combo of leaving </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Shark Tank </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and the Mavericks is positioning Cuban for something big, he's offering a different explanation.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"I have three kids, 14, 17, and 20. They are getting close to that age when they will be on their own. I want to try to have my summers to spend family time with them before they want to talk to me even less than they do today."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For that reason, he's out.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqaYq6NdmMKjrc1moKxlo5q5rbXNoGStoJVisaK4y5qqZqWRq7KztcKkqrCgmaGybr%2FToqOlZaKawaK1zaKloGWTpLu1vs6lZKieXam1pnnTnpimZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./if-baker-mayfield-wins-one-more-game-he-ll-make-an-extra-1-million.html><span>←</span><span>If Baker Mayfield Wins One More Game, He'll Make An Extra $1 Million</span></a>
