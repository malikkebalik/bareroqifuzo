The formal royal servant left his position in the royal family and didn’t return to the kingdom of Andalasia. While most of the characters made a comeback in Disenchanted, Nathaniel was nowhere to be seen.</p><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>So what happened to Nathaniel and why wasn’t he in the sequel?</p><h2 id=h-the-current-whereabouts-of-nathaniel data-injectable=false>The current whereabouts of Nathaniel</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Nathaniel was played by Timothy Spall, known for his role as Wormtail in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;series. He also played Winston Churchill during the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic games and is featured in other notable films and projects to this day. Knowing this, we know it’s possible for Spall to come back and reprise his iconic Disney role, but he didn’t. But his glaring absence is backed by a reasonable explanation.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true>The reason why Nathaniel isn’t in&nbsp;Disenchanted&nbsp;is because the sequel takes place in Monroeville, a suburb far away from New York City. So as Giselle and her family move away from the big city, Nathaniel is the only Andalasian left in New York. He’s possibly living his best life as a self-help author. But maybe it’s a good thing that he didn’t appear in the sequel. After all, he found his happily ever after.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>Disenchanted&nbsp;looks at life after the clichéd happily ever after and the promise of a fairytale love story after the end-credits roll. In a way, Nathaniel’s absence is the best route the film opts to display the same. While it would be cool to see him back, knowing that he is leading a happy life in New York should be more than enough. He doesn’t need Giselle or Edward to help him discover who he is as he already got his life sorted at the end of Enchanted.</p><p data-characters=50 data-current-count=50 data-injectable=false>Disenchanted&nbsp;is now streaming on Disney Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG66wK2fmqaZmrlutc1mm6KrlaOwqa3NrZydZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-golda-rosheuvel-dutch-race-and-nationality.html><span>←</span><span>Is Golda Rosheuvel Dutch?
